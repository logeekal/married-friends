          "v": "How do I begin this with? \nI feel so much pressure every day &#8211; every time someone calls from the family, every time I hold a baby in my arms, every time someone I know shares their “GOOD NEWS”.\nWherever I go, there is just one conversation starter &#8211; When I am having a BABY?\nEveryone keeps reminding me that I am a woman who is 33 now and now it’s been 5 years of marriage. If I won’t have a child now, I will regret it later. It doesn’t end there. It follows with more questions, more opinions, and more judgments.\nAm I so obsessed with my figure?\nHow come I don’t like babies? They are so cute.\nIs there any problem between me and my husband?\nWhy don’t we get our medical tests done? Maybe we have some medical issue. It&#8217;s quite common these days.\nFamily, friends, colleagues and even the lady who comes to our home every day to collect our garbage asked me these questions. \nAnd you know what gives me relief in this “BABY PRESSURE”? The fact that I am not alone. \nIt happens everywhere, in every part of the world, with every married couple. Hi-five buddy 🙂\nAfter facing these questions for 5 years now, there are certain things I learned or “WE” learned that really helps us to deal with this pressure peacefully. After all, we are a happily married couple and don’t want these judgments to ruin our peace of mind.\nSo my dear friend, just remember these 5 points and swim through this pool of “The Baby Pressure” peacefully.\n\nCommunicate with your partner\nBoth of you are together on this. Things become really easy when you and your partner are on the same page on this matter, when you both find a way together to deal with it. If someone said anything to you and it is bothering you, talk to your partner about it. But don’t do it every time otherwise you will end up ruining their peace of mind too 😛\nWhen do you want to have a baby is totally the decision of you two only. Both of you just talk about it, talk about your preferences, your priorities, your choices. And if you have already made up your mind, do not let any judgment or question bother you much. Do not let these things create problems between you two. Because the last thing that you want in your marriage is fighting over a baby who is not even born yet.\nUnderstand your parents\nYour parents or in-laws say things with good intentions. They are retired or they are at an age when they want someone to play with because obviously, we don’t have much time to spend with them. Right! Moreover, they do or say things which they have experienced in their life, which they believe is right. So, there is no point in losing your mind on that.\nBetter, just talk to them and tell them about your priorities in life. Tell them why you guys are not planning a baby. Your Reason could be anything &#8211; financial stability, career preferences or maybe you are not ready for it. Whatever is the reason, just let them know about it. There is no point in making excuses because like I always say, SET THE RIGHT EXPECTATIONS. They may not agree with your point but that is okay. But you be very clear about your decision. \nThey might even say that your biological clock is ticking. So, if you want to have a baby, just talk to your doctor and plan accordingly.\nSocietal Influence\nYou might feel the pressure when all your friends have babies. when all of you meet, they only talk about the diapers, sleepless nights, potty training, baby burps and you feel left out. You don’t have anything to add to the discussions. They even tell you how beautiful life gets when you become a parent and you have to experience this. They make it look like it is the best thing in the entire world.\nSometimes the pressure increases, even more, when your siblings or cousins have babies and everyone in the family starts to question you, judge you or even worse taunt you.\nBut just ignore it, stay silent, stay calm or you may even use humor to avoid these things. Humor works pretty well. \nIf someone asks you “When are you planning a baby?”.\nJust tell them “This weekend, as you both have off”. Laugh and move 😀\nMaybe this is a little extra but you got the point. Right!\nJust keep this in mind &#8211; don’t give in to the pressure and let others influence your decision. Because I am sure you would want to have a baby when you are 100% sure about it. Just like you don’t marry because everyone else’s getting married. Similarly, don’t have a baby because everyone else is having one or maybe two 🙂\nJust be okay with whatever you have decided. Handle the situation as you feel like. If you don’t want to talk about it, just say so. If you want to talk about it, just tell them honestly about your feelings, choices, and decisions.\nYou have made up your mind. Just be okay with that.\nIf you have anything to talk about or share, you can write to me at richa@marriedfriends.in\n I will definitely get back to you.\nTake Care.\nLots of Love,\nRicha\n",

          "v": "Actions Speak Louder Than Words\nBetween I and Jatin, I am the one who says “I Love You” a lot many times every day. It feels like it is at the tip of my tongue all the time. Not even a single day passed since last 8 years, I guess when I didn’t say these words to him. I can’t help it. I feel that love every time and every day.\nAs much as I love to say it, I love to hear it too. But he loves to tease me so much that he makes sure not to say it back. He often replies by saying “Hmmm… or okay or sometimes just Good”. Once in a blue moon, he will say “I Love You” to me. Those are the best days of my life 🙂\nBut you know what it never bothered me because his actions speak louder than his words 😛\nI completely understand that it is very easy for some people to say &#8220;I Love You&#8221;. And some people say it with their small gestures. You don’t need to plan anything or need any special skills to express your love. It is as simple as you want to make it.\nHere are few gestures that every couple must do to keep the romance alive in their relationship. \n1) Let her sleep a little extra\nIf your wife gets up early to take the milk from the vendor, to make breakfast for the kids, to finish up the household chores then let her sleep a little extra sometimes. It will really make her feel a lot loved.\n Even if getting up early is not your cup of tea then trying it sometimes won&#8217;t hurt anybody. It is such a small effort and you can not imagine the amount of love your partner will feel for you. And it works both ways. If your husband loves his sleep then let them sleep as much as they want to on weekends. That way they will get up with a fresh mind and will love you even more.\n2) Frequent Hugs\nHug each other when you wake up. Hug when he is cooking for you. Hug when she is setting up the breakfast for you. Hug when you leave for the office, hug when you see each other after coming back from office. Hug before you sleep. Just hug whenever you feel like. Hug even when you don&#8217;t feel like. \nHugs do have some magical power that brings a lot of smile and love between a couple. Try it out. What are you waiting for? Just go and hug first 🙂\nTL;DR Watch the Video Instead\n\n3) Be Thoughtful\nThere are times when we get so much engrossed in ourselves that we forget to notice our partner. We forget if they want something. We forget if they need something. But no matter how much occupied you are, your partner should be your number one priority.\nSimple gestures like covering your partner with a blanket while they are asleep, setting up the dishes while they are occupied with something, light some candles and let them relax convey a lot of love. Does these things need any special training. No. Yet these ways are very much effective to show your love.\n4) Goodnight Kiss\nNever ever go to bed without giving each other a sweet goodnight kiss. It is a complete No No! It is okay if you both are not going to bed together. It is not possible all the time. But do make sure to have a sweet moment of love before you go to bed. Just 5 minutes and you will be set for another day. Believe me. It is coming out from an experienced person 🙂\n5) Late Night Binge-Watching \nI know how tough it is for some people to be awake till late at night. It has become tough for me too since I started getting up at 5:00 am. But when we look back, watching late night movies on weekends and having Maggi in between is our most cherished memories. \nThat is why even today sometimes we plan to binge watch some series. Even though we have to take a cup of coffee to charge ourselves up but it is all worth it. And it is not just about watching movies or anything, it is about the quality time that we spend together.\n6) Listen\nBlessed are those women whose husband listen to them patiently without interrupting, without giving any advice or solution. Am I being stereotypical here 🙂 \nWell, the point is just to listen to your partner and they will feel loved the most. They want to be heard. They want to share. That&#8217;s it.\n7) Message From Work\nHow tough is it to send a “Hi or How’s your day going” from office? It hardly takes a few minutes but needs quite some effort to remind yourself for that. Just remember one thing that one small text message will add too much love and care in your relationship. You both will feel connected throughout the day.\nIt’s been so many years of our marriage and I still call him or message him every day just to ask him about the food 😛 Every day it is the same question “How’s the food today?”. Every day it is the same answer. Every day I feel the same emotion.\n8) Go Crazy\nI know you have to behave like mature or grown-ups after your marriage but why can’t you two be kids again? Just have some karaoke night or dance face-off night at the comfort of your home. You will have fun, laughter, and stress-free time together. This will add some really fond memories in your relationship.\n9) Bring Their Favorite Snack\nWhen you are out for some grocery shopping, bring your spouse’s or partner’s favorite chocolate or cookies or chips. They will appreciate and love the fact that you remembered their favorite things. You not only remembered their favorite snack but also remembered to bring it for them. \nSo, what is your partner’s favorite snack?\n10) Hold Hands While Walking\nIt doesn’t matter if you are married for 10 years or even more. If you still hold hands while you are walking, it means that you love to get connected to your partner. You still love the physical connection between you two and want to feel closed to each other, whenever you can.\n11) Be Thankful\nThank your partner for taking care of the family and kids. Thank your partner for making healthy meals for you. Thank your partner for making sure that you reach office on time. Thank them every day. Thank them with love.\nJust because you are married for years now and all that seems obvious and mundane, it doesn’t mean you don’t need to say thank you to each other anymore. Thank you is such an easy gesture that can make your partner feel loved at an instant.\nDo tell us how do you express your love for each other? Who prefers speaking these words and who expresses their love with small gestures?\nExpress your Love and Be Married Friends Forever!\n&nbsp;\nLove from Us.\nRicha.\n&nbsp;\n",

          "v": "All Couple Fights Are Same!\nOne day, I was having breakfast with my office colleagues. One of my colleagues joined us a little late. So, when we were having our breakfast conversations she was looking a little bit lost. We asked her about that and she said that she had an argument with her husband in the morning.\nI clearly remember that the argument was about &#8220;the husband was not able to find the socks in the almirah&#8221;. She said that she got pissed off with that as she was already getting late. The socks are always in the almirah in the left drawer. Still, her husband could not find it. Every day he asks her for that. That is why she got annoyed with her husband and they had a little banter.\nI was trying to absorb this conversation but everyone else on the table consoled her by saying that it is a common couple thing and there is no need to be bothered about that. Then everyone started sharing their similar experiences. \nOne guy said that he and his wife always fight over the messy bed. Another one said that his wife always complains about his shoes lying on the floor. Then one said that her husband never wipes the bathroom floor and every day she has to remind him for that. Are these arguments really common with all? What do you think? Do you have similar arguments with your partner?\nTL;DR Watch This\n\nSo, I was just listening to everybody and trying to understand that why this happens and how come everyone is okay with that. \nThen what happened, that conversation continued and spread in the entire office. Obviously, we were just 40 people in the office so everyone gets to know about everything that’s talked about. Everyone started talking about their silly arguments and proudly said that it happens every day.\nThey also mentioned that there fights and arguments keep the love alive. But I beg to disagree. My thinking was different from everybody and I was okay with that. But I kept thinking that how come everyone is okay with that. If these are such small issues they why do they have to argue over it?\nAre these fights really worth it?\nI used to think that couples’ chemistry has changed in our generation. Now they are more loving and expressive. Maybe I got this impression from social media and from my own experience too. But that day I realized that these arguments happen with everyone, couples of all generation and they are okay with that. They know that these issues are really small but they still fight over it.\nI was not okay with that. I will never be okay if I and Jatin will keep on fighting over small issues that can be easily ignored. We get such a short time after our hectic day of work. We prefer to spend that time in loving conversation and not on silly banters.\nObviously, there are many things that we don’t like about each other. For example, one of his most annoying habits is that he forgets to close the toilet door. How irritating is that? He makes sure to close the toilet door when he is at his parent’s house. But not in our home when I keep on reminding him for that.\nSimilarly, he also doesn’t like when I never take any interest in ordering food. He doesn’t like when I pack lauki ki sabji (bottle gourd) in his lunch box and he has to eat that. In my defense, it is healthy and I love eating that. \nWe can make a whole list of things that we don’t like about each other. But these things never came in between the love that we have for each other. We don’t fight over these things anymore. We used to and then we realized that is it really important to spoil each other’s mood for such petty things.\nWe realized that we both are different and have different priorities and different way of doing things. We are in this marriage together. We can’t expect each other to follow the exact same guidelines that we have made for us. We can’t make our partner be a clone of us.\nIs it Avoidable?\nOf course, it is. Why not?\n If you can avoid fighting over small issues like keeping a wet towel on the bed, you will save a lot of your time and your mood too. You will not only prevent your mood but also prevent your partner’s mood to get spoiled. \nImagine, if you take out the wet towel from the bed and hang it outside to get dry, how much time it will take &#8211; 2 minutes hardly. Now imagine, if you get annoyed with this wet towel on the bed and start arguing with your partner. Think about what will happen with your time and mood. Even if you prefer to argue to make your partner understand, do they really understand? Think about it. Is it really worth it?\nSo next time if you find anything disgusting about your spouse and the moment you start getting irritated, just ask 2 questions to yourself:\n\nIs it really worth it?\nCan I avoid it?\n\nDoes this seem difficult? Well, it is what you think it is.\nFocus on Positives\nJust focus on the positive qualities that your partner has. There must be a 1000 things that they do for you and you love that about them. Just focus on those things and don’t let their habits annoy you. \nAppreciate them for what they are doing for you. This will boost their confidence. They will try to put more effort to make you feel happy. \nIf you keep on arguing over those silly things, they will eventually stop showing love for you. You will lose the love, excitement, care and all that energy that you both have.\nYou want to fight over it or you want to stay calm and save your energy for something good. You can make your decision. I am not saying that it is easy but it is not impossible. We practiced it and the result is &#8211; No fight in 2018. Not even a single fight. Unbelievable, Right?\nIt is not like we suppressed our negative feelings but we ignored if it is petty because that is not worthy of our love. And if it is a bigger matter then we have our ways to resolve that. We discuss over it and come to a conclusion. The point is, we put the effort into having a loving relationship. It doesn’t happen in a day but it happens eventually.\nMarriage is not about expecting the other person to be perfect in everything. It is about two imperfect people who genuinely try to make a perfect marriage. But if you let these things annoy you all the time or even sometimes, you will not be happy within. And if you are not happy, you can not make a happy marriage.\nThe choice is yours!\nThink! And Be Married Friends Forever!\nLove From Us.\nRicha\n",

          "v": "The Biggest Decision of Life!\nFinding “The One” is not about finding the perfect guy or the perfect girl for you. It is about finding someone who will be just the perfect for you. It’s about finding someone who is the right match and a perfect fit for you. It’s also about being “the one” for someone else. It works parallelly.\nWhat I feel is that finding “Love” is still easy but finding someone with whom you are going to spend your entire life is very very tricky. It is a very big decision of your life and you can’t afford to make a mistake in that. 1 tiny mistake and you will bear it for the entire life. It is the sad truth. Face it!\nBut you don’t need to be afraid of. You are a grown up and much-sorted person. You know what you want from your life and what you expect in a relationship. And we are always there for you.\nHow we found our “Perfect Match”?\nIt’s 2018. We are married for 4 years now and are together for 9 years. And we think that we did a great job in deciding to marry each other. We are just two imperfect people who are perfect for each other. We call ourselves &#8220;Married Friends&#8221;!\nWhen we first met and started to talk to each other, we were pretty quick to fall in love. We had a lot in common, used to talk to each other every single day. We had a long distance relationship and we used to be so excited to meet each other. \nBut even after 2 wonderful years of dating, we were very confused about marrying each other. In fact, Jatin was more confused about the decision. He used to say that he loves me but can not make a commitment to marriage.\nFor him, finding “THE ONE” is not just about finding someone with whom he can have a lot of fun or who shares the exact same passion. It is also not about finding your clone. In fact, it is about finding someone who is prepared to make the relationship work at all times. \nI completely agree with what he said and it made so much sense to me. Marriage is a bumpy ride. It is not easy at all times. Even after marriage, we keep questioning ourselves, whether we made the right decision or not. Whether the person is fit for us or not? These things are normal as long as you are passionate about making it work.\nSo, here are a few things that helped us in making the biggest decision of our life. These are our opinions based on our 9 years of experience. \n1) You don&#8217;t need a third wheel\nWhen you two are together, you don’t need anything or anyone else to keep the fun alive in your relationship. You don’t get bored at all. \nThis is something that we think is very important because there comes a time when your friends get busy with their work, they get settled somewhere else or they get married. You lose touch with them. Only you and your partner will be there to keep the entertainment, the chemistry, the fun fresh in your relationship.\nJust see, if you can have the same fun with each other without the need of anyone else.\n2) Respect your Individuality\nYour partner respects your individuality, your identity, your values in life. They respect and support with what you want from your life.\nYour partner gives you space so that you can have your own independent life, your own friends, your dreams. It is not necessary for you two to do everything together. What is important is to support each other with their way of life.\nThis way you both grow individually and learn from each other.\nTL;DR  Watch the video instead&#8230;\n\n3) Agree to disagree\nYou both can disagree with each other. You don’t always need to agree on everything. It’s not necessary to like the same stuff, to match everything. It’s not possible all the time. And it is okay to have differences and different opinions. \nBut what is important is that if you can talk about your disagreements. You both can have different ideas, different opinions but still, you can learn to work together. \nDon&#8217;t let your differences come in between the love that you have for each other.\n4) Accept the way you are/are not\nIt is important for your partner to accept you exactly the way you are and especially the way you are not. \nIt’s unfair to assume that with your love, you can change the other person. It doesn’t work that way. Change comes from within. \nIf you can’t tolerate their things that you don’t find lovable like smoking, drinking, workaholism, anger, laziness, messiness, irresponsible behavior, emotional unavailability etc., then they might not be the right partner for you.\n5) You can be yourself\nYou can be your true self with that person. You don’t need to fake anything. You don’t need to be like your Instagram profile or your LinkedIn profile. You don’t need to do anything “especially” so that the other person can like you more. You just can be yourself.\n6) Sex is not the biggest element\nWhen you think about each other, you think beyond sex. We are not saying that it’s bad to think about sex but if you only look for some time together alone so that you can have sex, then chances are that it’s not a good sign. \nIf you both are emotionally connected and can enjoy each other’s company without the need for having sex all the time, then you are with a right partner.\n7) Trust\nYou can trust your partner completely. Trust is something that comes over time. It doesn’t come easily. That’s why it is important to give time to your relationship, know each other well enough and then take a call whether you want to spend the rest of your life with that person or not.\n8) Think as &#8220;We&#8221; not &#8220;I&#8221;\nYou think of each other as “we” or “us” rather than thinking of “I” or “me” all the time. When you decide to live with someone 24 hours, it can not be just about you only. You both have to come to the same conclusion despite having all the differences and arguments. \n9) Make you forget your Phone\nIn today’s age, we are more distracted by our phone than attracted to our partner. So if your partner can make you forget your phone, we must say that then you are very lucky.\nMarriage is a lifelong commitment. Take your time and don&#8217;t rush into it. Don&#8217;t take the decision because everyone else is getting married or your biological clock is ticking or there is pressure from family or society.\nDon’t listen to your friends and family, don’t rely on what Google has to say. Just listen to yourself. Because only you know how you want to live your life after marriage. \nLet us know if you agree with these points or not. \nIf there is anything else that is important, just comment down below so that others who are looking for the answers can learn from our experiences.\nStay Connected!\nAnd Be Married Friends Forever!\nLove from Us.\nRicha\n",

          "v": "What exactly is a “Date Night”?\nIf I ask you when was the last time you went on a date? What would you say? Is it anything related to what I mentioned below:\n\nIt’s too much of an expense.\nYou are totally occupied with work and other social commitments.\nYou keep going out for dinner and movies…\nAll your free time goes looking after your kids.\nDate nights are for new couples only. They need it.\n\nSee, there will be endless reasons for not doing this. But guys, date night is not just about going for dinner and then movies or not at all about booking some fancy place and spend a lot of money there. It is about spending some “Screen-Free Time”, only with your partner, where you connect with each other. You communicate, bond and develop the friendship in your relationship.\n\nDate Night = The Best Night of the Week!\n\nDating is not a Luxury. But a Necessity!\nThese days everyone is so busy with the work, with parenting, with other social commitments. But that doesn’t mean that you start taking your partner for granted. We generally don’t think that we take them for granted but you answer yourself&#8230;\n“When was the last time you appreciated each other and not on social media but face to face”? \nWhat was the last time you expressed your love for each other?&#8221;\n&#8220;When was the last time just the two of you went on a date?”\n\nDating is more important for your relationship than you think!\n\nDating is very important for your relationship than you can actually think. It’s an investment in your relationship. The more time you give, the more connection and bonding you will have. \nYou have to keep nurturing your relationship. Your relationship should also grow as you are growing. It should get better and more mature with each passing year.\nThe Relationship is Work!\nYour relationship with your partner is a full-time job. And it’s a fact! The way you think that how you can make things better at your workplace, how you can improve yourself there, you think of new ideas, new goals etc. Similarly, you have to think of ways of how you can maintain the newness in your relationship. \nDating in a very good idea to induce freshness in your relationship. Remember that your relationship needs your full focus and attention. Don’t neglect that at all. Think of new ideas to maintain connection and newness in your relationship. There is always something new to discover about your partner. \n\nAlways Remember, someone’s effort is a reflection of their interest in you.\n\nIf you can manage to take out the time once a week, it means you are doing great. Even once every two weeks is fine. It shows that your relationship is your priority. You are creating a special space for one another. You are making your partner feel that they are important for you.\nKeep the Novelty Alive\nInclude new things in your relationship that you both can enjoy together. That way you will be motivated and excited to take out the time for each other. You will look forward to the time when you two will be together. \nWhen you do new things together, try new places, new activities, there always remains newness in your relationship.\n Otherwise, you must have heard people saying that it’s been 3 years now of our marriage. It’s not as romantic as it used to be. Don’t fall into this trap. Do something that you both enjoy doing together. It cultivates we-ness in your relationship.  \nIf you like to stay fit, try working out together. If you both love to dance, go for dance socials. If you both love games, plan a date in a gaming center. After the game or workout or whatever it is, you will end up talking about how you felt about doing it together. So don&#8217;t wait for any special occasion and just mark a date on your calendar.\nPlan For Dates Often, Especially After Marriage\nWhen our relationship is new, we plan special dates so that we can bond with each other, get to know each other. We try to be aware of what’s new is happening in our partner’s life. But after a few years of living with each other, we don’t feel the need for it. We think that we know everything about each other now. We are familiar with our partners, their likes, dislikes, habits, schedule etc.\n\nDo what you did in the beginning of the relationship. Then there won’t be an end.\n\nBut as we keep growing, we go through a lot of changes. We think differently. We start taking things differently. And we don’t talk about all those things on a regular day. That is why dating is very important where you can dive into your partner’s heart and know them well.\nIt doesn’t matter if you just got married or in a relationship for 10 years now. There are things to always discover about each other.  \nThere must be something new that they experienced but not getting the time to share. There must be something that they wanted to share but forgot to due to the daily hustle bustle of life. Discover these things on your dates and stay connected with your partner. This will create a deeper connection that will go a long way.\nWhat do we do on our dates?\nWe prefer to go out for dinners on our date nights. We both cook at home that is why going out for dinner gives us freedom from cooking. We save a lot of time and that time is spent with each other. \nWe also made a pact that till we reach home, we won’t look at our phone. We won’t talk about anything related to our youtube channel or any creative idea that we thought of for our work. We will only and only talk about each other. \nWe completely understand how tough it is to start the conversation on dates. This usually happens when we think that whatever we need to know, we already know that about our partner. We also face challenges and our conversation keep on coming back to our work which we generally don&#8217;t prefer. But now we are getting hold of it. So you can also do that.\nWe prepared a set of questions that you can use to start the conversation. Just try that and those conversations will take you to the deepest part into your partner’s heart. You will bond more and develop a strong emotional connection.\nIsn&#8217;t it surprising that such a small gesture can create deeper meanings in your relationship? It keeps the relationship and romance alive. It keeps you two connected for the lifetime. \nSo enough said. Now take out your calendar and see when you can plan a special date night with your love.\nKeep Dating! Stay Happy! Stay Connected!\nBe Married Friends Forever!\nLove from us.\nRicha\n\n",

          "v": "Kitchen &#8211; The Heart of Every Home\nThese days, our work has taken a toll on us. We get up, rush for office and then spend hours in traffic to reach there. We keep ourselves busy in the office for the whole day. There is no fixed time to leave for the home. Some days are lucky when we manage to leave right on time but we all know how often that happens 😉 At the end of the day when we reach home, we are dead tired. All we want to do is have our meal and sleep.\nNow you figure out yourself, in 24 hours how much time you took out for your partner &#8211; the person you love the most? \nWell, what if I tell you that with all this daily hustle bustle, there is one space where you both can spend time together, talk and laugh together &#8211; every single day. That space is the kitchen &#8211; the heart of every home.\nYou both need food, Right? Then why not cook it together! You will not only end up having tasty food but also will have a great conversation with your love.\nWe Connect while Cooking Together\nWhen it comes to cooking, I and Jatin always cook together. It is a great thing that we both love to cook. We experiment a lot in the kitchen. Whenever we eat something in a restaurant, we see how we can make it at home. \nWe GOOGLE the recipe, look for the ingredients and then have a “Master Chef” event in our home. We cook almost everything at home. Well, everything but Sushi 😀 \nSometimes it becomes confusing about what to order and what to eat out because we make everything at home and we make it good 🙂 We make Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Indian, Dhaba Style&#8230;You name it and we will make it and invite you over. Deal!\nAlso, even if only one of us is cooking, the other one just hang out in the kitchen and that is the time we talk to each other. We talk about anything and everything 🙂 Sometimes we even talk about stuff that we talked 1000 times before. But it is just fun.\n\nDo you have kitchen OCD?\nA lot of wives say that they prefer cooking themselves than letting their husbands cook and making the whole mess of the kitchen. But ladies, make sure that you don’t think at all about the mess that your husband creates and the cleanliness that you need to do after he cooks.\nJust appreciate the fact that they are cooking with you. This might be something absolutely new to them and they are making that effort to change because they care about you, empathize with the workload you have, they want to make you happy. Focus on the positives. Moreover, If you cook together, you will have a deeper understanding of each other which in turn will bring more love and connection in your relationship.\nHow do you bond more if you cook together?\nSince we always cook together, we can very well say that it is a great way to strengthen your relationship. You don&#8217;t realize any of these things while you cook together but while reading just take a pause and think how true is that. So, let’s see what happens when you cook together.\n1) Respect Each Other\nIn India, even today, it is believed that cooking is woman’s department. But guys, you can not imagine the level of satisfaction that your wife gets if you cook with her. Even if you don’t know how to cook, you can help her in doing the preparations or you can just be there and talk to her and that will make her immensely happy. She will respect you and love you even more. \nWives feel so much proud when they tell others that their husband cooks or even helps in cooking. I personally love the response that I get when I tell others that Jatin makes chapatis every day. It was very usual for us but everyone else made me realize that it is such a big thing and that made me so proud of him and so happy about our relationship. And as rightly said&#8230;Happy Wife = Happy Life.\n2) Communication is the Key\nWith our busy lifestyle, it’s difficult to get time to bond with each other. Cooking is something that makes you 100% focused and completely present on what you are doing. Since you need both your hands while cooking, it’s hard to get distracted by the phone or anything else. So now, with no phone around, talk to each other, share about your day, tell each other something new. \nAnd Most of the times, these small talks will end up in deeper conversations on the dining table while you eat. This way, you will be aware of what’s going on in your partner’s life.\nTL;DR  Watch the video instead&#8230;\n\n3) Acceptable to Constructive Criticism\nWhen you both cook together, you learn how to give constructive feedback or criticism to each other. You don’t want to hurt the other person’s feelings and prefer to be honest too. That’s how you develop the habit of saying things in a more positive way.\nYou replicate the same thing in other parts of your life. You become naturally conscious about your partner’s feeling and eventually, it brings you two closer.\n4) Create Fun Memories\nYou can have so much fun in the kitchen, you can be playful and exchange hugs and kisses while your food is cooking. A lot of times we practice our salsa moves in the kitchen while we wait for the cooker to whistle. And believe me, this way cooking doesn’t seem a daunting task. So don’t worry about playing Holi with some flour. Sprinkle some salt on your man, spill water on her head, all in good fun. You will start enjoying cooking more.\n\n5) Novelty in Relationship\nYou both have diverse taste preferences. Therefore, you experiment a lot with the ingredients and try to make new things every time. Our friends say that we make gourmet things in the kitchen (you can check our Instagram highlights and decide yourself 🙂 ). It’s because we both have a different take on how a dish can be created and this results in many delightful delicacies.\nWe also daydream about opening our own cafe where I will serve all the healthy dishes and he will make his special signature dishes just once a week. \nYou won’t realize this but this brings more happiness and newness in your relationship otherwise it gets boring after a time. Also, you will feel proud about learning a new skill. \n6) Equally Indulgent in Grocery Shopping\nIf you both are cooking, you both know where the ingredients are kept in the kitchen, you both are aware of what is needed and what’s finished. You both get equally indulgent in grocery shopping. You will have one more thing to do together and you can’t imagine how enjoyable your grocery shopping can be. \nSo Guys, if you haven’t done this before, grab your partner’s hand and get some spaghetti, some fresh exotic vegetables and call it a date night in the kitchen. We all know what magic will happen after that.\nAlso, let us know if you enjoy this new way of dating. Easy idea, Right!\nAnd Be Married Friends Forever&#8230;\n&nbsp;\nLove from us.\nRicha\n",

          "v": "Stay Connected Every Day!\nYou might have heard that “Couples who workout together, Stay Together”. \nStay together doesn’t just mean that you both are living under the same roof. It also means that you are sharing your lives with one another, you make each other the important part of your life. And to do that you surely have to spend some time together. And if you can do it every day, then why not?\n\nCouples who workout together, stay together!\n\nDue to the work demands and increased work pressure, it has become really tough for us to spend time together with our partner on weekdays. We look for the weekends when we can talk, share and do things together. But why to lose 5 days every week when you can manage to do things together and stay connected every single day. \nStudies have proved that couples who work-out together are more satisfied and more in love and it also improves the quality of your romantic relationship.\nIf you are already working out then why not do it with your partner. It really helps to connect you even more with your love. \nBenefits of working out with your partner\nWorking-out together is a very good way to spend time together. Whenever it is possible for us, we both go for jogging together, we do yoga together, sometimes we even go swimming. That is why we never felt that we are not getting enough time for each other. \n\nMagic happens when you integrate Health and Love.\n\nWith today’s work culture, you don’t know when you are going to come home from the office and have some quality time with your partner. If the workout is already there in your routine then it’s better to set a date and do it together. Obviously, you won’t feel like you are on an actual date but believe us, the time spent will be unmatchable.\nWith this, you can keep yourself fit and give the time to each other which is very important to stay connected and stay in love FOREVER. With our personal experience, below are some benefits if you work-out with your partner.\nMore Positivity and Happiness\nWhen I was working in the office, my colleagues used to ask me that how come I stay positive and happy every day? I was never stressed, never shouted or argued with anyone and always used to greet everyone with a smile. And when I was asked repeatedly, everywhere I worked, I thought about it and then I realized that it may be because we start our day by working out together. \n\nGood things come to those who sweat.\n\nIf you are working out in the morning, it starts your day with a positive mood, it makes you feel fresh. And if you do it with your partner, it brings closeness and happiness in your relationship. That is why you stay energetic, positive, stress-free and happy throughout the week.\nYou don’t need to do it every day, even 2 to 3 days a week works wonders. Twice a week and you will be charged up for the entire week 🙂\n\nAchieve Fitness Goals\nWorking out together helps you achieve your fitness goals. It encourages you to run for 2 extra kilometers, inspires you to do 10 extra pushups. You learn new things, new ways. Your partner encourages you to achieve more and push your limits. You also do it because you want to show your love towards your partner and you feel encouraged to go for it.\n\nI thought of giving up but then I remembered who was watching me.\n\nI personally don’t like jogging and when I go alone I only finish one lap. It doesn’t matter if it’s of 1 km or 2 Kms. I just finish that lap and that too by taking a lot of breaks in between. But when we go together, he pushes me so much while jogging “Run Richa, You can’t stop Richa”. This, one day, made me complete 5 km without taking any break. That was one big achievement for me and it was all because of him.\nLikewise for him. He does stretching post jogging only because I love stretching and yoga. He also does it because he loves to do it with me.\nBetter Team \nWhile exercising, you try to coordinate your actions with your partner. You try to run or walk at the same pace, you try to match your stretching with your partner, you match your plank timings. This is called the Non-Verbal Mimicry and this makes you two a stronger team and you feel more emotionally bonded. \n\nTeam Work Makes the Dream Work.\n\nYou won’t even realize this while you workout but studies found out that one way to connect and bond with your partner is to practice non-verbal communication. This also increases the friendship in your relationship which is very much important for a healthy relationship.\nLess likely to skip\nMost importantly, when you work-out together, you are less likely to skip workouts. Between us, I am more particular about exercising regularly and Jatin says that I am the reason that he gets up on time and workout. Isn’t it sweet? But only I know the feeling of waking him up in the morning for a workout 😛\nEven if he doesn’t work-out with me, at least I make sure that he works out. If one of you is pumped up for work-out, you can motivate the other one. Sometimes it’s me or sometimes it’s my husband, Jatin. That’s how we push each other. \nSo, motivate each other and encourage each other and you’ll feel more positive about your workouts and your partner.\nFun Memories\nYou even create some fun memories when you work-out together. And I remember my happiness and excitement when I completed 5 Kms. Jatin says that I was literally jumping like a monkey. Actually, I was. I have this psychological barrier that tells me to stop jogging 🙂 It’s funny but it’s true. I can run for long but I don’t as I don’t enjoy jogging much. \nSo, when I finished 5 Kms without any break, I was out of this world. I told everybody in my family and my friends about it. I still think about that time. It was all because of him. And now that moment pushes me to jog more without taking a break. Now I very well know that I can do it.\nKeeping all these things aside, the best thing is when people call us a young &amp; fit couple 🙂 We are in our 30’s but, we look young, energetic and so much in love, that they think that we are in our 20’s. I consider it as a compliment. It just feels awesome.\nThis is it. So, don’t worry if you come home late and then all you want to do is eat, watch tv and sleep. But make sure to connect with your partner in the morning every day. You always wanted a friend who can accompany you for work-out. Now you have a friend living with you. Make use of this. \nStart your day together, do some workout and Stay connected every single day. \nAnd Be Married Friends Forever&#8230;\n&nbsp;\nLove\nRicha\n&nbsp;\n",

          "v": "Do you wait for the weekend to spend quality time with family?\nWhen you get married, during the initial 1 year or so you try to spend as much time as possible with your partner. You have so much to talk about, laugh about, you plan special date nights, do things together at home etc. etc. etc. But with time, these things start to fade away and new things come to your life.\n You adapt yourself to that without realizing what you are leaving behind. You focus more on your career, try to earn more and more money, start a family, do a lot of future planning but with all that your quality time with your partner takes the back seat. With all that planning, we forget to make time for each other every single day. \nYou wait for the weekends to have a quality conversation with our partner. But imagine you are losing 5 days a week with that.\n\nIt&#8217;s not about &#8220;having&#8221; time. It&#8217;s about making time.\n\nBut if you think carefully, all these things are temporary even parenting for that matter, but what will be there lifelong is the connection between you and your partner. So you have to put some extra effort, manage and make time for each other every day. \nAnd it’s just a matter of 30 minutes a day (on weekdays of course). But those 30 minutes should be yours &#8211; no phone, no office call, no kids and talks related to kids….just have the real communication &amp; spend time together.\nMake Time for each other &#8211; Every Day!\nIs it possible? It is, my dear friend. Let me share our experiences on how we stay connected every single day despite all the workload that we have. We just need to make minor adjustments in our lifestyle and we can promise each other to have a lifelong connection. \nHere are a few things that we included in our lifestyle to make time for each other every day.\n1) Sweat Together, Stay Forever!\nGet up a little early and workout together. I know how tough it is to make this commitment but believe me, do it for a week and you will feel like doing it every day. \nNothing better than starting your day together with your love. The day starts with some fun, positivity, and togetherness. And you feel happy and energetic throughout the day. No wonder people used to tell me why I am happy all the time. \nOne added benefit &#8211; everybody will call you a ‘Fit Couple’ and it feels awesome to hear that. \n2) Have a meal together!\nHave at least one meal of the day together. \nNo matter how late we come home from the office, even if it&#8217;s 12 at night, we make sure to have our dinner together. That is the time when we talk about the entire day &#8211; anything good or bad happened, our work pressure and this relieves the entire stress of the day. And the next day starts afresh. \nPlus, the more you talk, listen &amp; share, the more connected you will be with your partner. You will know what is going on in your partner&#8217;s life.\n3) Take up new hobbies together\nWe are telling this to you from our experience. Join some hobby class together. It could be dance class, cooking class, tennis or anything that you both can enjoy together. It makes you two a better team.\n You coordinate your actions, try to achieve the same goal and helps you connect even more.\nAlso, if joining a class is not possible, play some games, solve puzzles in the comfort of your home. You will find a reason to laugh and celebrate small victories. It is always better than lazying around at home. \nTL;DR  Watch the video instead&#8230;\n\n4) Do Chores Together\nDoing household chores together is the best way to connect with each other as it takes up most part of your day at home. It not only helps you empathize with each other but also develop a mutual respect for each other. Moreover, if you work together, you don&#8217;t think of it as a burden. It becomes so much fun. It remains like that forever.\nSo, why work alone when you have a partner who promised to accompany you everywhere. But give them the space they need so that they be the best partner you ever imagined. \nHave trust on your partner that they will do the things and embrace the differences.\n5) &#8216;Remember Me&#8217; Night!\nPlan a date night weekly and only you two should be there alone &#8211; no friends, no family, no kids, and not even your pet. Dress up like you used to get dressed during dating times. And please do not talk about your house chores, pending bills or what new your kid did. NO! Talk about the times you shared together. \nAnd if going out is not possible, plan it at your home, in your living room. Just light some candles, order some food, play some jazz and get romantic. The idea is to spend some quality together where you can remember and talk about all the good times you had together. The nights like these keep the romance alive in your relationship.\n6) Review your day together\nWe know that after your long hectic workday, all you want to do is get lazy on your couch and watch Big Boss! But imagine the amount of time you are losing in knowing what Salman Khan said to Heena Khan and then what did she do. There is nothing wrong in that but don’t you think that it would be much better in knowing what your partner did and how was their day??? \nI and my husband know each other for eight years now and not even a single day passed when I didn&#8217;t ask him about his day. It&#8217;s a simple question and obviously, he answers it in two words every time. But that becomes the conversation starter between us. That&#8217;s why we know each other in and out. Communication is the key to have a happy and strong relationship.\nSo, friends, all these ways are tried and tested by us and we can give you 100% guarantee that these minor life adjustments will bring you two a lot closer to each other. If you want to have a happy and healthy relationship, you have to put some extra effort required to build that. Nothing in this life comes easy and relationships are toughest to build and nurture.\nSo, Stop waiting for the weekend!\nStop waiting for an occasion!\nStop waiting for the perfect moment!\nRather, make each moment perfect&#8230;\nLet us know in the comment section about your favorite idea to stay connected with your partner every day.\nBe Married Friends&#8230;Forever!\nLove from us!\nRicha\n&nbsp;\nP.S. :\nHere are all the blogs of Stay connected series.

We can not move forward and see what our current actions will result in. And we can not play or pause either. It would have been so cool if we could do all those things. But we can’t! That’s the sad part but it’s the reality of life.\n The time that&#8217;s gone is gone forever. We all have 24 hrs a day, spend it wisely. Give time to your family as they are your support system.\n If you don&#8217;t prioritize between work and your relationship, you will have a life full of regrets. So, you have to figure out how you can have a perfect balance between your work and your life. \nIf you want to work late night to impress the people you don’t like or you want to go and attend your kid’s dance performance in school. You want to earn more money so that you can buy things that you don’t even need or you want to live a happy life with your partner. The choice is yours. \nHow do you want to balance your work and your relationships?\nIs it all worth it?\nWe spend most part of our life sitting in our office chair, tapping through the laptop, trying to keep our inbox zero, answering calls, listening to our bosses, attending those never-ending meetings and scrolling through our phones in between that. There is more work left for the day in spite of continuously working for 9 hours. We slog in office, ignore the calls we get from our family and when we reach home, we have just one thing to say &#8211; I had a really busy day. \n\nYou can’t do a good job if your job is all you do.\n\nWe are working day in and day out, proving our worth to our bosses. We want to be the best at our workplace so that when the time comes, we will get promoted and move up the corporate ladder. \nBut with that, we lose behind a lot of precious moments in our life. We lose our happiness, our family and the time we want to spend with them. The time that will never come back once it’s gone. \nYour family, your kid won’t remember the money that you have earned for them but they will always remember the time you shared with them.  So, it’s you who need to think of striking the balance between work and family. Both are equally important. \nTL;DR  Watch the video instead&#8230;\n\nTake the lead of your life\nWe want to make money as much as we can so that we can have fun in our retirement &#8211; when we will have less energy, strength, and enthusiasm for life. But what can we do? \nWe can not take a pause as we will be left behind then. Our work demands us to be online 24&#215;7 and respond to emails and calls whenever they come. We have to be on our toes. But it’s you who can decide how you want to lead a happy life. \nPrioritize what is important for you. Choose what needs to be done that will be fulfilling for you and for your family.\n\nIf you don&#8217;t design your life, Someone else will do it for you!\n\nWe all demand for flexible timings, work from home facility, paternity leave but all these will never address the core issue that we are dealing with. Even if your company allows you to work from home, it means that now you can work extra without wasting time in commuting and that too for the same amount of salary they pay you. \nGovernment and Corporations are not going to solve this core issue for us. They try to take as much out of us as they can. It’s their nature, it’s in their DNA. Even the good intentional companies do that.\n So stop looking outside and take control and responsibility of your life. If you don’t design your life, someone else will do it for you. \nNo good decision is made in a swivel chair\nTake a paper and write down how you want to spend your day maintaining the work-life balance. And then see how you are actually spending that day. \nIf there is a difference, STOP. See how you can improve and work for it otherwise, you will have a life full of regrets. Regrets for not giving the time to your family that they deserve. Regrets for not attending your kid’s annual function, for not being there when your wife was going for the regular check-ups when she was carrying your baby, for not being there when your dad was in the hospital. \nAnd regrets will be there for the lifetime. You will regret when your kid will not have anything to share with you because there was never any connection between you two. There will be regrets for the moments you haven’t spent with your partner. You can not recreate those moments. You can not rewind your life and go back. But what can you do NOW?\n\nIt&#8217;s time to INTEGRATE your work and your life.\n\nYou can not say “No” to the work but you have to figure out how you can give time to your family and not just on weekends or on birthdays or anniversaries. In fact, every single day. Figure out how you can integrate work and life.\nSmall Things Matter\nHaving a balanced life doesn’t mean that you need to make some dramatic changes. Even the small investment in the right places, at the right time, can transform the quality of your relationships. \nCall from the office whenever possible and tell each other about the day and how you enjoyed lunch. Have a date night after office and who says it needs to be an expensive affair, have a quality talk for 10 minutes before you go to bed. \nDon’t waste the time you have on silly arguments. Focus on the positives and love each other every day.\nHow do we stay connected every day?\nIt&#8217;s 2018. We have been married for four years now. All these years, I never missed asking him about the lunch that I pack for him. It’s the same question and the same answer every day. \nWe still hug each other when we leave from home and reach back. We have the most romantic talks in our kitchen when we cook together. No distractions at that time. You surely can’t have that if you focus on the mess he creates in the kitchen. No matter how old your relationship gets, some things should never change. \nAnd if you see, these are not some rocket science things or life adjustments that we need to make. These are minor day-to-day activities and it keeps us connected. P.S. Minor if you do it together 😀\n\nYou will never feel truly satisfied by work until you are satisfied with life.\n\nSo the point here is “Small Things Matter”. Just try how you can integrate work and life. \nMoreover, we think that with this approach, you can transform society. If enough people will start doing that, it will change society’s definition of success. The society that believes that the winner in life is the one who makes huge money. Rather winner is the one who had a life well lived.\nAnd this is the idea worth spreading…. \n&nbsp;\nLove from us!\nRicha\nBe Married Friends&#8230;Forever!\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n",

Maybe you don’t but a survey says that 60% of people believe in this and in fact, 41% of men and 29% of women have experienced love at first sight.

If you do then, GAME OVER. \nThere is no such thing as marriage at first sight as it is a lifelong commitment. You get a chance and you have to get it right. You can not depend on your instincts to make a decision for a long-term relationship. You just can not say that “It Clicked”. Some people even keep things on destiny but you have to be totally sure when it comes to marrying someone. \nGive time before you jump into the conclusion of marrying someone. Give time to know each other well. It needs time and patience to build a strong foundation.\n Just like the strong foundation of a building keeps it stand tall while the forces of nature wreak havoc. Similarly, the strength of a happy relationship lies in its deep-rooted foundation. \n\nGrass is greenest where it is well watered.\n\nYou may say that you don’t have the time to invest in knowing someone. Maybe you are 30 or 40 or 50. You just want to find someone with similar interests and leave everything else for the future. But then, be prepared for the unwanted shock coming your way right after your marriage.\nAvoid Conflicts After Marriage\nYou must have heard it from your friends and family that first year of marriage is the toughest. It is very challenging. And it is true for both &#8211; love marriage and arrange marriage. \nEven we faced the tough times despite the fact that we dated each other for 4 long years before getting married. We fought, argued and figured out some new things that we never thought of when we were going around. \nThat is why we are sharing some points that you must discuss with your partner before getting married. Figuring out these things will help you before making the final commitment. It will prepare you for future conflicts. It will help you decide &#8211; Is he/she the one for you?\n1. Why him or her?\nSometimes people say that it just clicked or they rely on their instincts but you should be clear about why do you want to marry that person. You must be aware of the expectations of your partner. There are some important qualities that you look for in your partner, and there are some traits which we do not want in them.\nFor example, being a liberal woman, I had some beliefs, thoughts, values, and expectations for myself. Jatin (my husband) completely supported me on that. Similarly, he wanted a friend more than a wife and he saw that in me.\n Also, as we went along, we came to know that we share similar values and that is very important for any relationship to grow well. We both wanted to put our parents on priority, prefer to go on date nights often no matter what, think that uncomfortable talks bring comfort in a relationship. We both believe in focussing on positives and lead a happy life. We both prefer to travel alone at least once a year. All these things we common in us. \nSo, you also make a careful decision. Just don’t go for marriage because he loves to travel or she cooks. There is more than that in a relationship to stay connected.\nTL;DR  Watch the video instead&#8230;\n\n2. House Chores (The mother of all conflicts)\nHusband is not the head of the family anymore (I am sorry husbands but it’s true). In fact, both are the managers of the home 🙂 \nWith both of you working, you can’t put all the household burden on one person. That won’t be fair. Unless the other person willingly wants to do everything. Although that’s a rare case 🙂 \nIf one person continues to work without asking for help, then after a few years, they will start getting irritated with the amount of work that they are managing single-handedly. Then it will result in arguments and fights. So plan accordingly.\nWomen have the tendency to do everything out of love but there comes a time when they start expecting their partner to help them. But in my opinion, you have to set the expectations right from the beginning of the relationship. It&#8217;s okay if you don&#8217;t like to do any particular thing but be honest about it and see how you both can manage that.\nWho is going to cook? Who will clean the house? What if the maid won’t show up for a week? Who is going to pay the bills? These questions sound small and simple but have the potential to turn your world upside down after marriage. \nSo, discuss among yourself about how you are going to share the load after marriage. But don’t marry thinking that the other person will change after marriage. \n3. Career Aspirations\nDiscuss career goals. If you are planning to change the job or the field entirely, want to go for further studies, start something of your own, or even if you are planning to take a break &#8211; Talk about it. \nThese things might change with time but at least you will have the idea about the person’s aspirations and ambitions in life. \nYou will be able to plan your finances and lifestyle better. You will know how much money will come home every month and what kind of living standard you will have. Whether you will have air conditioning in all rooms or just in the bedroom and that too while sleeping 😛 \nBelieve me, these things do matter 🙂\n4. Kids and involvement with them\nThis is something that people avoid &amp; leave for the future. But you must discuss it. Maybe your partner doesn’t want to have a baby or will have after 3 years of marriage. Maybe he won’t be involved in changing diapers or losing his sleep to take care of the child. Perhaps you plan to quit the job to raise your child. What are their views about infertility or adoption? You should be aware of these things.\nYou will get to know about all these things as you get along, spend time and talk to each other. These things are very important that every couple should talk about.\nNo one can be sure about these things because, with time as you grow up, a lot of changes happen.\nI have a friend who never wanted a baby but his wife wanted one and that too right after marriage as her clock was ticking. It created some tension between them and he used to avoid that topic. I remember how worried he used to be. I used to wonder why he never talked about it despite having a love marriage.\n5. Location\nWhere are you going to live after marriage? Are you planning to move and settle in a different country? Or you are going to live with your husband&#8217;s parents? How comfortable are you staying with the in-laws? If not, confront it as guys are very particular about that. \nAre you both okay with living in different locations because of your job or further studies? Or you will leave the job and move wherever your partner goes?\nWe discussed this and decided that no matter what, we will always live together. We will move together or else we won’t move at all. But now, things are quite easy. I can work from anywhere, wherever he takes me 🙂\nI have friends who after marriage were not living with their partners and that too for years. Some were living apart for studies or some for jobs.\nBut I think there has to be a clear understanding between you two otherwise things get worse even leading to divorce. Scary, right?\n6. Smoking &amp; Drinking Habits\nFinding someone who doesn’t drink or smoke is quite a task these days. Some people are okay with drinking/smoking but for some this habit is intolerable. Don’t marry if you are not okay or thinking that you will make them quit eventually. \nIn case of arrange marriage, people lie about it in front of everyone on their first meeting. But make sure to confront it with the person you are going to marry. Be very open to it, don’t hide it. Who knows you may just find the perfect partner in crime. \nAlso, discuss if they will quit when the baby comes if that’s important for you. You have to make an adjustment together in this case.\nWe both don&#8217;t drink or smoke and we wanted someone like that only for us. No compromises for us in this case. And yeah, luckily we found each other 🙂\n7. Leisure\nHow do they prefer to spend their leisure time? Are they introvert and want their space where they can relax, read a book and do something on their own or they prefer to invite everybody to a house party?\n Are they going to do things which you both can enjoy together or prefer to have the alone time with their friends? Are they interested in going on dates after marriage or they prefer to save money by not dining out?\nAre you okay if your partner parties with their friends? Is it alright, if they plan a meal with a friend of the opposite sex? \nYou should know these things to understand the personality of your partner and to be aware of the fun that you are going to do together.\n8. Finances\nApart from the salary, it is very important to know if the person is in some kind of debt or how they are planning to pay. \nEspecially, you should ask the lady if she has taken any education loan or any other loan. Who is going to take care of that? Is she or her parents are going to re-pay or the burden will come on the man’s head? Be very clear and straight about asking this.\nHow you both are going to manage the finances after marriage? You should also get some idea about how they spend money. Are they thrifty or spend blindly on online shopping? Do they earn to travel or earn and save for the future?\n9. Family medical history or any medical problem\nWe have seen people hiding about their medical condition or some family medical history and getting divorces because of that. \nThere are some cases where the partner gets diagnosed with a severe medical condition after marriage and then it becomes difficult for the other person to take care of the deceased person. Sometimes they even leave the person. \nBe very clear if you had been or still are under any medication. Ask each other to get some tests done before marriage. People are hesitant of asking and the other person might also get offended if asked. But it makes so much sense to avoid future problems. \nI know that it is very difficult but this difficulty seems smaller than the future problems that it may cause.\n10. Religious Beliefs\nYou should know if a person is atheist or agnostic or how much do they believe in God.\nIf you are going to have an inter-religion marriage, how are you going to manage with the beliefs and traditions of the other culture? It is very important for a woman to see how comfortable will she be in following the traditions of the in-law’s place.\nAlso, if you both are of the same religion, how are you going to celebrate the festivals. There are couples who celebrate all the festivals at the husband’s parents house only. And there are couples who divide the festivals between both the families. Whatever suits you, decide beforehand.\nSince we both are from Delhi, our parents live there. We had this uncomfortable discussion after marriage. It is a belief in India that the daughter-in-law has to celebrate all the festivals at in-laws place only. But we both decided that if we are in Delhi, we will celebrate with both the families.\n11. Surname Change\nIt is a very small thing but might lead to so much of conflicts later on.\n Changing the name or surname doesn’t matter much for some women but I always wanted to keep my parent’s surname. I discussed it with Jatin and he was pretty cool about this. Sometimes, your in-laws are not okay with this but if you already made it clear with your husband, it won’t cause much trouble. \n\nThese are the 11 things to discover before tying the knot with ‘’the one’’. These are not like quiz questions that you ask and the other person will be prepared to answer. You will know these things as you get along. That is why it is important to give some time to know each other well. It happens slowly &amp; gradually as you merge into life. \nBefore marrying someone, ask yourself “Can you accept them as they are?” Don’t assume that they will change magically after marriage. If they change, let it come from them.\nBe Married Friends Forever&#8230;\n&nbsp;\nLove from us!\nRicha\n&nbsp;\n",
