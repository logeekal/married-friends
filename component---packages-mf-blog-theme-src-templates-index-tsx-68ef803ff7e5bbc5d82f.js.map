Adding\n   * wildcards will increase the number of documents that will be found but can also have a negative\n   * impact on query performance, especially with wildcards at the beginning of a term.\n   *\n   * Terms can be restricted to specific fields, e.g. `title:hello`, only documents with the term\n   * hello in the title field will match this query. Using a field not present in the index will lead\n   * to an error being thrown.\n   *\n   * Modifiers can also be added to terms, lunr supports edit distance and boost modifiers on terms.

Edit distance is also supported\n   * to provide fuzzy matching, e.g. 'hello~2' will match documents with hello with an edit distance of 2.\n   * Avoid large values for edit distance to improve query performance.\n   *\n   * Each term also supports a presence modifier. By default a term's presence in document is optional, however\n   * this can be changed to either required or prohibited. For a term's presence to be required in a document the\n   * term should be prefixed with a '+', e.g. `+foo bar` is a search for documents that must contain 'foo' and\n   * optionally contain 'bar'.
