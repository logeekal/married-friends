So just try it out. It is one of the easiest burger recipe you will ever find.</p>\n","content":"McDonald&#8217;s changed the idea of burger patty in such a way that I used to think that a burger patty has to be ultra-crispy. You should be able to hear that crunch sound in every bite. I started thinking that if the burger patty is not crispy, it is not well made or maybe not that tasty. But my views have totally changed now. \nDOES A BURGER PATTY NEED TO BE CRISPY?\nAbsolutely Not! When we moved to Munich, Germany, on one Friday night, we decided to order a burger. We both ordered a veg burger from this place &#8211; Pizza Avanti. When I took the first bite, oh my dear God. It was not crispy at all but the flavors were oozing out in every bite. That veg burger was very tasty and it was the patty to which I want to give the whole credit. Literally. Then I realized that the patty need not be crispy or crunchy for a good burger but more important for it is to be juicy and flavourful. If that is sorted, you will have a wonderful time eating your burger.\nHere is one such burger. I made the patty with red kidney beans or rajma and for some extra umami flavors, I complimented it with chilly and sweet mango salsa. Although this is quite a healthy burger since the patty is not fried and is rich in protein but this burger is so tasty that one won&#8217;t be enough for you. Unless you have a tiny stomach like me 😀 If you want to make it extra healthy, just remove the buns and eat it as is, or as some people do &#8211; replace buns with lettuce leaves. I will never do that 🙂 \nIf you are in hurry, just watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nTIPS TO MAKE IT RIGHT\n\nMoisture Content: It would be difficult to make a firm patty if there is a lot of moisture in the mixture. That is why it is important to balance the moisture in the patties. You should be able to cook a perfectly shaped patty and it should not feel dry too. For that, add poha (rice flakes) or bread crumbs to the patty mixture. They will absorb the excess moisture and make a firm patty. But don’t add a lot of it otherwise the patty will become dry.\nResting Time: For the poha or bread crumbs to absorb the moisture, you need to let the patty mixture rest in the refrigerator at least for 30 minutes. If you have time, let it refrigerated overnight. That develops more flavor and makes delicious patties.\nPatty Size: Don’t be tempted to make a big patty. The burger will just start to fall apart with each bite. Make sure the size of the patty is equal to the base of the burger bun. I am talking diameter here.\nLayering: Have you ever experience soggy buns? It is a total turn-off in burgers. That is why correct layering is important. Make sure that the buns are toasted well. It gives a nice crunch and prevents sogginess. Also, if you are using the store-bought burger sauce or mayonnaise, apply that first. The sauce contains oils that prevent moisture from getting into the bun. If you have homemade sauce or chutney, place the salad leaves first.\nBurger Sauce: To get a burst of flavors, apply the sauce on both halves of the bun. If you miss the top half, it just feels tasteless.\n\nBt the way, do try our incredibly delicious veggie burger too. It is juicy and flavourful. It has a nice crunch of crispy fried onions. And the game-changer of all is the chilli paprika sauce. You must try that too. \nVeggie Burger\nOne good thing about these burgers is that you can double the batch of patties and freeze them in your freezer. They will last for a few weeks in there. Whenever you are craving burgers or just some patty, thaw them and then cook. We prefer to eat the extra patties with fried rice or pulao. Have you ever tried that? It gives a feel of sizzler 😀 Now let&#8217;s jump right onto the recipe.\nHere is the written recipe:\nBurger FAQsHow do you build a burger?First, toast the buns well. Then apply burger sauce or mayonnaise on both halves of the bun. The sauce contains oil which prevents the moisture from seeping into the buns. Place the salad leaf. On top of that goes your patty. Place raw onions or tomato slices and cover from the top bun. Insert a toothpick to hold everything together. If you have any other ingredient like fried onions or mango salsa etc. place it on top of the salad leaf. This way nothing falls when you take the bite.\nCan we store the burger patties?Yes. Of course. You can refrigerate it for around 5 days. You can also shape the patty and freeze them in an airtight container for up to a month. Just thaw them slightly before cooking.\nWhy my burger buns get soggy? How to fix that?Layering is important to prevent the sogginess of burger buns. Always apply the burger sauce or mayonnaise first. The sauce contains oils that prevent moisture from seeping into the buns and making them soggy. You can also place the salad leaf instead. If you are using a homemade sauce or chutney, do not apply them to the buns first. They contain moisture and will make the buns soggy.\nWhy my veggie patty gets mushy?Vegetables contain a lot of moisture that makes the patty soggy and mushy. It doesn&#8217;t hold the shape well while cooking. To prevent that, add binding ingredients like bread crumbs or poha (rice flakes). They absorb the excess moisture and helps the patty holding its shape. But do not add too much of it otherwise the patty will become dry. No one likes a dry burger.\n\n","instructions":"Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mash slightly with a fork to squeeze out the juice and make it a little mushy.\nLeave aside for 30 minutes to combine all the flavours well.\nStrain all the water from the boiled or canned rajma (kidney beans). We don't need any water to make the patty.\nRinse poha with some water and let it sit for a few minutes.\nMash rajma well with a potato masher or a fork. We don't need any chunks here so keep going :\nAdd all the ingredients in the bowl. Don't forget to add poha. That is the hero ingredient here. Combine everything well with a spatula or your hands works best for this.\nShape the mixture into patties. Make sure the diameter of the patty should not exceed that of the base of the bun.\nRefrigerate for at least 30 minutes. That helps in developing more flavours. Also, the poha added will absorb the moisture from the patty and make it more sturdy.\nHeat oil in a pan and place patty on it. Brush oil all over. Cover and let it sear on medium-low flame. Don't disturb the patty till it is done. It will take a few minutes on one side.\nFlip. Cover and let it sear on the other side too.\nGently brush some butter on one side. That makes the patty even more tasty.\nPlace a cheese slice over the patty and cover it for a minute. Let it melt on the patty itself.\nSlice burger bun in half.\nLightly brush a pan with some oil or butter and toast the buns from both the side.\nFirst apply burger sauce on the bun and place some lettuce leaves on top. That helps in sticking the lettuce and also prevents the buns from getting soggy.\nPut a few spoons of mango salsa on top. Then comes the patty and then tomato &amp; onion slices.\nBefore placing the other half of the bun on top, apply some burger sauce on it. We don't want that bun to be bland.\nHere is your burger.

Yes Please! Try this 1-Minute Mango Smoothie (Vegan). It is a perfect and a tasty way to include some seeds in your daily diet. So make it and never make an excuse to skip breakfast 🙂</p>\n","content":"\nNo. It is not a fancy name for mango milkshake. And No. It is not a foreign term for aamras. 😀 Mango Smoothie is different. It has its own identity. And after reading this, you will also realise that.\n\nBefore sharing the recipe, let me first give you an easy guide to make any Smoothie. Just by following this guide, you will be able to create your versions of smoothies with your choice of ingredients. \n\nIf you don&#8217;t have the time, you can quickly watch the mango smoothie recipe video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key elements of a smoothie are:\n\n\nFruits &amp; Veggies\n\nAdd fruits that are more pulpy and sweet like banana, mango, pear, apple etc. because that will make the smoothie thick and smooth. I don&#8217;t prefer to add citrus fruits since I don&#8217;t like that tanginess in my smoothies.\nSmoothies are a great way to include greens in your daily diet. I mostly prefer green smoothies. You can add any kind of green but my favourite is spinach since it doesn&#8217;t make the smoothies bitter. Some greens do 🙂 \nOther veggies that go well in smoothies are zucchini, beetroot, ginger, celery, carrot.\nCombine fruits &amp; veggies with similar colour. That is totally optional. But if you like your mango smoothie to be yellow, don&#8217;t add spinach or beetroot in it. Add light colour fruits like pear or banana so that you get a bright yellow smoothie. But if colour is not your preference, just blend anything which is available.\n\n\nLiquid\n\nLiquid is added to blend the smoothie well. You can add any liquid &#8211; water, milk, any vegan milk, curd. \nI don&#8217;t prefer to add water since it dilutes the taste. Same goes with the ice. If you like cold smoothies, just cut and freeze the fruits. That will also give smoother consistency.\nI prefer oat milk in my smoothies as it gives a better taste to it.\n\n\nNuts &amp; Seeds\n\nI say this a lot that we can easily grab some nuts and eat it but it&#8217;s not the same with the seeds. Our body needs it but it keeps getting ignored. Am I right? I think that smoothies are a best way to include all kinds of seeds in your diet. There are plenty of options &#8211; chia seeds, flax seeds, sunflower seeds, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds etc. So, just throw in what is available and you are sorted for the day.\n\n\nHerbs &amp; Spices\n\nHerbs and spices are not just for the flavour but they also have tonnes of benefits. they are one of the richest sources of antioxidants. I mostly prefer fresh mint leaves, basil, cinnamon or turmeric.\n\n\nNatural Sweetener\n\nI like my smoothies sweet. Though I add banana but that is not enough for me 😀 Instead of adding sugar or jaggery, try adding dates or raisins. They add an amazing flavour to the smoothies. \n\n\n\n\nSo that&#8217;s pretty much it. Serve it in a bowl and top it up with some more fruits, seeds, granola or just pour it in a glass and sip it. It is very simple, quick to make, healthy and nutritious. No more excuses for not having breakfast in the morning. If you don&#8217;t have the time to eat, just drink the breakfast.\n\n","instructions":"\nThrow in everything in a blender and blend until smooth.\nPour it in a glass and Enjoy\n\n","ingredients":" 1 cup Mango\n 1/4 cup Carrot\n 1/2 cup Oat Milk\n 4-5 pieces  Cashews\n 1 tsp Sunflower Seeds\n 1/2 tsp Chia Seeds\n 1 tsp Coconut\n A Few  Raisins\n A Few Leaves  Fresh Mint\n 1-2 pinch Turmeric Powder\n","uri":"/recipe/1-minute-mango-smoothie/"},"763":{"id":"763","title":"Baked Cheese Balls","excerpt":"<p>Why Fry when you can Bake?</p>\n","content":"I haven&#8217;t met anyone who doesn&#8217;t like potato cheese balls. Have you? \nIf you have clicked on this recipe, it means you are someone like me. Someone who loves potato cheese balls, of course but someone who doesn&#8217;t like to deep fry stuffs. I have this theory in life that why deep fry anything if you can bake it and make it equally good. And that&#8217;s what I did with these cheese balls. \nIf you are in a hurry, watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of baking potato cheese balls:\n\nThere is no fear of cheese leakage that results in even more oily cheese balls.\nSince they don&#8217;t spread, you can bake a lot of cheese balls together and it takes just 10 minutes to get perfectly baked and cooked. Isn&#8217;t it fantastic?\nSince it is made with zero oil (Yes! You heard it right.), no oily fingers when you have it. It bothers me 😀\nYou don&#8217;t need to reuse the same oil in which you have deep fried. It is not healthy to use that oil but I understand you can&#8217;t even throw that out. Hence, Bake It.\n\nMy recipe is slightly different from other recipes not just because it is baked but in this recipe, I did not use any refined flour slurry. You can make any cheese balls with whole wheat flour slurry. You will get the same crispiness, cheesiness and exactly the same result. You don&#8217;t even need to add cornstarch in the slurry. Also, I did not use any bread crumb or refined flour in the mixture for binding. That&#8217;s the beauty of baking. Your mixture should be just good enough to roll it into balls. Since baking is dry cooking, if you will add flour or bread crumbs and make the mixture dry, you will end up with dry cheese balls and you won&#8217;t like that. Hence, avoid adding that. Add it only if your mixture feels wet and you are not able to roll it into balls or it is not holding its shape. \nHow to make Bread Crumbs at home?\nFor the potato cheese balls, you will also need bread crumbs to coat the balls. You can buy it from the stores too but it is quite simple to make at home. Just take a few slices of breads, pulse it a few times in your mixer grinder till they are coarsely ground. Do not make the crumbs fine. We need it slightly coarse. After that, roast it till they turn slightly brown and crispy. You can even store these roasted bread crumbs for months. Put it in an air tight container. Roasted bread crumbs make the baked cheese balls very crispy. \nNow let&#8217;s dive right into the recipe.\n","instructions":"\nBlend all the ingredients till you get a smooth paste. \n\nCombine all the ingredients in a bowl and mash everything well till you get a smooth dough like mixture.\nMake small sized balls and keep them aside.\nMake slurry by whisking all the ingredients well. Continuously whisk while adding water else the slurry will form lumps.\nPreheat the oven at 200 degree celsius, fan setting.\nNow dip the balls in the slurry first and then drop them into the bread crumbs. Coat them all over with the bread crumbs. \nRepeat the same with all the balls.\nIf you added 1 Cup cheese, then double coat the balls to make sure that the cheese doesn't leak. For that, after first coating with the bread crumbs, dip the balls again in the slurry and then coat it all over with the bread crumbs.\nOnce all the balls are coated, put them on a baking tin and bake for 10 minutes, middle rack.\nAfter 10 minutes, it is ready to serve. \nEnjoy :)\n","ingredients":" 6 slices  Bread\n 2 (medium)  Potato\n 1/2 cup Cottage Cheese/Paneer\n 1/2 to 1 cup Mozzarella Cheese\n 2  Green Chilli\n 2 tbsp Fresh Coriander\n 1''  Ginger\n 2 clove Garlic\n   Salt\n 1/4 tsp Black Pepper\n 1 tbsp Nutritional Yeast\n 1/2 cup Whole Wheat Flour\n 1 cup Water\n 1 pinch Salt\n 1 pinch Black Pepper\n 1/2 cup Cottage Cheese/Paneer\n 1 tbsp Tomato Paste\n   Salt\n 1/4 tsp Sugar\n 1/4 tsp Black Pepper\n 1/4 tsp Chilli Flakes\n 1 tbsp Olive Oil\n 2  Basil Leaves\n 1/4 cup Water\n","uri":"/recipe/baked-cheese-balls/"},"765":{"id":"765","title":"Veg Lasagna","excerpt":"<p>Serve lasagna to your guests and be ready for all the appreciations coming your way.

Plus, if you have friends coming over, with a little effort you can serve many people at a time.</p>\n","content":"\nHonestly, I never liked lasagna in restaurants. They are so full of mozzarella cheese that you don&#8217;t get any other flavour but cheese. May be it is like a heaven for cheese lovers. But my husband also loves cheese and he loves lasagna too. He had good lasagna in one or two places but for other restaurants where we tried, he agrees with me &#8211;  So Cheesy. Not us but the lasagna 😀 \n\nAnyway, Since he loves lasagna then I had to try it at home so that I can make it for him anytime he wants. Oh man. we are a cheesy couple 🙂 When I made it for the first time, we both said &#8211; this is the best lasagna we ever had. In fact when Jatin saw me adding carrots in lasagna, he said that he hates carrots in lasagna. But I wanted to try it my way. And he just couldn&#8217;t control and finished the entire lasagna. Then we made it back to back every weekend for the next 3 weeks. It is that delicious. \n\nIsn&#8217;t it so tedious to make at home?\n\nWell, it seems so. Making two different sauces then layering and then baking for 30-40 minutes. I also used to think that. But when you start making it, it gets done quickly. White sauce doesn&#8217;t take much time. For red sauce, just chop some veggies and cook. Then just layering is left which is quite fun to do. That&#8217;s it. And then just light some candles, play some music, open a bottle of your favourite drink and carve your lasagna 😀 Sounds romantic haannn. Well it is.\n\nIf you are in hurry, watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips to remember while making lasagna:\n\n\nPre-soak Lasagna Sheets: Even if your lasagna sheet packet says that it is oven ready, just soak it in hot water before you start prepping up the sauces. If you will layer the dry sheets directly, it will absorb the moisture from the sauces and your lasagna will be dry. \nLump Free White Sauce: Getting lumps in white sauce is a pretty common problem. But to avoid that, add a little amount of milk first and keep stirring till the milk is all absorbed by the flour. Repeat the same thing and you will get a lump free white sauce. Btw, do you know that I make white sauce with whole wheat flour and not all purpose flour. Don&#8217;t worry. You won&#8217;t even notice the difference.\nGrated carrot in red sauce: I prefer to add grated carrot because it gives a nice colour to the sauce and also it gets soft and you won&#8217;t get that carrot bite while eating lasagna. That just ruins the experience. Every layer of lasagna should feel soft and smooth. \nLet it rest: Resting time after baking is very important. If you won&#8217;t let it rest and slice it right away, the sheets will fall off and you won&#8217;t like that. I know it is difficult to wait but just do it. Once your lasagna is out of the oven, let it rest and set for 15-20 minutes at least. Don&#8217;t worry. It will still be hot. \n\n\nJust keep these points in mind and now you are ready to make a perfect veg lasagna at home.

Here is the recipe for flavourful homemade chili oil.\nFried Garlic and fried onion: We both love garlic. Although I am not a big fan of deep-frying stuff but for this recipe, I did that. 2 words &#8211; Too Good. You don&#8217;t need to pour a lot of oil into a pan and fry garlic and onion. If you have a tadka ladle that is deep enough would work absolutely fine. Just heat some oil and fry thinly sliced garlic and onions and fry till they are slightly golden. Do not darken else they would taste bitter.

When my husband and I were dating, we used to go to the same Chinese restaurant every week and order the same thing every time &#8211; Noodles with Manchurian. Back then, we were not even aware of other Chinese cuisines. Even during the Shaadi season, I always used to be excited about noodles and Manchurian. How about you?\nMaking that classic mix veg Manchurian gets quite cumbersome at times. For that, we have a solution &#8211; crispy, tasty Gobhi Manchurian. It is so easy to make and you get that similar feel of Manchurian. You can make it a little saucy and enjoy it with noodles or make it dry and enjoy as a starter. Or if you want to experiment more, you can even make wraps from these. It tastes really good. Just add some green chutney and some raw onions and noodles along with that. Yummm Meeee 😀\nNot Fried but Baked\nIf you have been following my recipes for a while, you know I avoid deep frying as much as I can. Jatin loves Gobhi Manchurian and when I saw its recipe online, it was deep-fried, and if you want it to be extra crispy, deep fry twice. Oh boy. I decided to make the baked version of the same which doesn&#8217;t require any oil at all. Still quite crispy. That&#8217;s why I just love my oven. Greatest kitchen invention of all times 🙂 Isn&#8217;t it?\nAnd did I tell you that this gobhi Manchurian recipe is quite healthy too? Not just because, I baked the cauliflowers but also the coating is made of whole wheat flour and not refined flour &amp; that&#8217;s what I call, the cherry on the cake. \nIf you are in a hurry, watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to make the baked cauliflower crispy?\nTo be honest, you can&#8217;t expect cauliflower to be extra crispy and crunchy since it contains a lot of moisture. But with the right techniques, you can manage to get crispy results.\n\nCutting the cauliflower florets: To get crispy results, make sure that the size of florets is small &#8211; around 1-inch piece. If it is bigger in size, it would take longer to cook, and cooking cauliflower for long makes it more mushy and soft. Another point to keep in mind is that do not cut the stem from the center of the florets. That opens the gates of moisture and prevents it from getting crispy. Try and take out the florets as a whole. Whole but small. Also, try to cut out as much stem as possible since it doesn&#8217;t crisp up.\nCoating: Do not put a thick layer of coating because then you will get the taste of flour in the bites. I tried different variations of coatings and one that gives the best result is with the bread crumbs. And make sure you are using roasted bread crumbs, which makes the bite even more crispy. You can use whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, cornmeal, or rice flour. Corn starch is important with these flours because that helps in making it crispy. \nTemperature: I baked it at 180 degrees celsius, top-bottom setting, for 40 minutes. That gives them enough time to get well cooked from the inside and crispy from the outside. If you keep a higher temperature, the coating will get crispy fast but the inside won&#8217;t be cooked enough. \n\nIf you will keep these points in mind, you will have an amazing experience with this recipe.

What makes it even better is the lemon zest added in the batter and the streusel topping. Must Try.</p>\n","content":"\nBerries always fascinated me so much. They are so colourful, vibrant and not to forget &#8211; full of antioxidants. When I was moving to Germany, eating berries was at the top of my To-Do-List. Literally. Now I tried all sorts of berries. They are the best when in season. Of all the berries we tried, blueberries are our favourite. They are incredibly gorgeous, sweet and the colour it releases when cooked &#8211; Oh My God. I mean is it blue, purple, pink? Who can tell? But it looks so drooling. Make a blueberry sauce and top it over the pancakes or cheesecakes. Wao. That&#8217;s what i call a real beauty.\n\nTalking about the muffins, homemade ones are the best. You can eat 3 or 4 and still crave for more. Whenever I bake these blueberry muffins, they don&#8217;t last more than a day. I make so many variations of these muffins &#8211; with streusel topping, with granulated topping, or a simple one with just a few extra blueberries on top. I like these with the streusel topping but Jatin likes the simple one. He just wants to enjoy the sweetness, the tanginess of blueberries in his muffins. \n\nIf you don&#8217;t have much time, watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI added lemon juice and lemon zest in the batter because it goes quite well with the blueberries. I even added lemon zest in the streusel topping because it makes them more delicious and the aroma is beyond words. You can make it without these two but I would suggest trying it once. \n\nTIPS TO BAKE IT RIGHT\n\n\nMake sure that all the ingredients are at room temperature. Plan it ahead so that you have enough time to take out your butter, curd, lemons out of the refrigerator and let them sit on the counter for a while. \nMeasure your ingredients correctly. Extra butter will make it greasy. Less butter will make it dry. Adding extra flour is one common mistake. Just fill your measuring cup with the flour and then level it off with a knife. \nSift all the dry ingredients &#8211; flour, sugar, baking powder, salt. This ensures that there are no lumps in the batter. Sometimes our sugar looks lump-free. But they still have tiny lumps that are not noticeable. You can&#8217;t correct that later. So it is better to sift your dry ingredients first.\nDO NOT over mix. This is something that happens accidentally. Over mixing crushes all the air bubbles and you end with dense muffins. To ensure that the muffins are light, airy, and fluffy, mix the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients in parts until they are just combined. That means you don&#8217;t see any dry ingredients left in the bowl. \nEven without the eggs, you can make perfectly soft and moist muffins. Flax egg or Chia egg and curd are the perfect substitutes. You can even use sour cream. \nDO NOT overfill the cupcake liners. These muffins rise a lot and if overfilled, they might spill out of their moulds. Fill 3/4th of each cupcake liner. \nYou may feel that the batter is a little dry and not easily pourable. But keep it like that. The blueberries release the moisture on baking and if the batter is too wet, the texture of the muffins won&#8217;t come out right. \nAdd blueberries in the flour and not at the end. If you add berries at the end, they just sink at the bottom of the liners. Mixing them with the flour makes them stay in between. I don&#8217;t know how it works but that is how it is. \nOnce baked, let it rest for at least 10 minutes if not 30 minutes. Blueberries release a lot of liquid and they need some to set. Obviously, you can have it right away. Just take care of your tongue. You don&#8217;t want to burn that. But I prefer to wait. Once they are set, you can see the gorgeous color inside your muffins. That is irresistible. \nBaking Powder helps the muffins rise. Double-check to make sure it has not expired. \n\n\nNow grab all the ingredients because you are ready to bake these blueberry muffins. These are soft, moist, tender and not at all dry. In fact, they don&#8217;t even dry up the next day. If they can last that long 😀 I think it is because of the flax egg and the curd that we use in this recipe. They keep them moist even on the next day.\n\nIf you like this recipe, please share photos and tag us on Instagram &#8211; marriedfriends.

Adding blueberries at the very last moment before transferring to your tin makes them sink at the bottom.\nCan we use frozen or dried blueberries?Yes. Although fresh blueberries are more delicious, they are not always in the season. You can use frozen and dried blueberries too. DO NOT thaw the frozen berries as they will release a lot of moisture while baking. Use it straight from the freezer. If using dried blueberries, soak them in water for 5-10 minutes to make them hydrated.\nWhy muffins come out dry and crumbly?Muffins become dry and hard if the batter is overmixed or the muffins are baked for long. To make them stay moist and fresh even on the next day, add curd, flax egg, or chia egg to it. It keeps the muffins soft and moist. You can even add butter and oil both. Butter tends to solidify on cooling and makes the muffins dry. Using oil along with butter will keep the muffins soft and moist for long.\nWhy my blueberry muffins flat?Muffins come out flat if you forgot to add baking powder. Another reason is that you let the prepared batter sit for too long and did not bake the muffins right away. If you will not bake it right away, the leavening agent will die and make your muffins flat.\nHow do we know that the muffins are done?Follow the temperature and the timing of the recipe. Also, once you start getting the aroma of muffins, that is a clue that muffins are almost done. Keep an eye on them and let them bake till they are brown on top. Insert a toothpick at the center. If it comes out clean, they are ready.\n\n","instructions":"Mix ground flax seeds and water.

No Eggs. No Gelatine. No Cream Cheese. Vegan. Light. Healthy.<br />\nVery Delicious. </p>\n<p>It is a Must Try.</p>\n","content":"\nI used to think that making cheesecake is a difficult task until I made these mini ones. This recipe doesn&#8217;t have any cream cheese, heavy cream, or butter. They are made without any gelatine or agar agar. These are eggless and the best of all &#8211; These Are Vegan. \n\nWHAT MADE ME TRY?\n\nIf you are following me for a while, you know that I always try to make things healthy without compromising on the taste. I always avoided making cheesecake because of the amount of cream cheese or heavy cream this recipe demands. But when I moved to Germany, I started craving cheesecake a lot. I blame all the bakeries here for putting such deliciously gorgeous cheesecakes right in front of your eyes. They follow me everywhere. But I couldn&#8217;t buy them because they are all made of gelatine or eggs. \n\nWhen my cravings reached the peak, I decided to make it myself at home. But of course, Healthy. \n\nCHALLENGES\n\nThis cheesecake does not have any cream cheese, heavy cream, gelatine, eggs, or cornstarch. These are the ingredients that help in setting the cheesecake. It needs fat for it to set perfectly. Even if we are not sure about the fat content, we add gelatine which does the job well.\n\nI decided to make it vegan and I was so nervous about it. I let it sit overnight and I just could not sleep the whole night. The first thing I did in the morning was to check the cheesecakes. Oh my. They were perfectly set. I could not believe my eyes. I could not control my excitement. I was so happy. But the last hurdle was still there to pass &#8211; The Taste Test by Jatin. I was nervous again. But he passed this recipe. He loved it. He said that this is one tasty dessert recipe which he can have every day. Yay.\n\nIf you are in hurry, watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDO WE NEED GELATINE?\n\nIf you don&#8217;t know, gelatine is a non-vegetarian food item. It is made from the skin of animals. If you are a vegetarian, you can use agar agar. These days you can even get vegetarian or vegan gelatine too. \n\nWhile trying this recipe, I realized that you don&#8217;t need gelatine or agar agar to set the filling. If you have the correct proportion of fat and moisture in the filling, it will set perfectly. If I can do it with the vegan filling, I assume that it will be a lot easier with the regular cream cheese filling. I still had to try that. But after having this, I have no plans for that as of now. Moreover, these cheesecakes are quite light and &#8216;Summery&#8217;. You can have more than one and won&#8217;t feel sick at all. \n\nBut you will need the gelatine if you want that shiny, fruity, gel-like layer on top of your cheesecake.\n\n\n\nVEGAN CHEESECAKE FILLING\n\nCommon ingredients for the vegan cheesecake filling are:\n\n\nSoaked Cashews &#8211; Soak the cashews overnight. It helps in making a smooth paste. If you don&#8217;t have that much time, soak it for at least 30 minutes in boiling hot water. Rinse well. \nSilken Tofu\nCoconut Cream &#8211; Chill the coconut milk in the coolest part of your refrigerator. Take out the top creamy layer and use that in cheesecake. Use high-fat coconut cream. You can even use the cream from high-fat coconut yogurt.\nVegan Cream Cheese\nCoconut Oil &#8211; Coconut flavor goes well with mangoes. But if you don&#8217;t want the coconut flavor in some other recipe, use the refined coconut oil. It doesn&#8217;t contain a strong coconut flavor.\nVegan Cookies &#8211; If you can not find vegan cookies, blend instant oats with some nuts and coconut oil. You can also use a mixture of nuts like almonds, walnuts along with soft dates (no oil). \n\n\nI did not try the silken tofu and vegan cream cheese yet.\n\nTIPS TO MAKE IT RIGHT\n\n\nDo not press the cookie crumbs too hard. They will become dense and it will be tough to break them with a spoon. Apply medium pressure. \nDo not add coconut milk to blend the filling mixture. Remember, we need to maintain the fat and moisture ratio. \nLemon Juice is added to give sourness that is there in regular cheesecakes. \nIf they don&#8217;t come out clean, put them in the freezer for 15 minutes. Don&#8217;t worry. They won&#8217;t become hard. Even if they do, put them back in the refrigerator. They will be all right.\nIt is hard to wait for it to set. But have some patience. Let it sit for at least 4-6 hrs in the refrigerator, if not overnight. Although if you keep it overnight, it becomes more flavourful. \nServe refrigerated. They start to melt and become very soft at room temperature. So, always serve them straight from the refrigerator.\n\n\nTOPPINGS\n\nYou can enjoy these as is or garnish with some beautiful toppings like:\n\n\nMango slices and mint leaves\nStrawberry pieces\nStrawberry sauce\nFresh Blueberries \nBlueberry Sauce\nWhipped Cream\nWhite Chocolate Shavings\nLemon Zest \n\n\nTangy fruits go well with the cheesecakes. \n\nNow grab all the ingredients because we are ready to set our cheesecakes. \n\nIf you try this recipe, please share photos and tag us on Instagram –&nbsp;marriedfriends. We love to see your creation of our recipes.\n\nCheesecakeWhy did my No-Bake cheesecake not set?For no-bake cheesecakes to set perfectly, it needs to have the right amount of fat and moisture in the filling. If it has a lot of moisture, it will be difficult to set it. Apart from that, refrigerate it for at least 4 hrs, if not overnight.\nWill my cheesecake set if it is runny?If your cheesecake filling is too runny, it will take more time to set in the refrigerator. Even after keeping it overnight, it doesn&#8217;t set, increase the quantity of fat in the filling the next time you try it.\nHow long should you chill cheesecake?A minimum of 4 hrs is needed to set it perfectly but preferably overnight. keeping it overnight also develops more flavour to the cheesecake.\nWhy is the base of cheesecake too hard?If you compress the cookie crumbs too hard in the baking tin, it will become difficult to cut them with a spoon or a fork. When you chill the base in the refrigerator, it becomes dense and too hard to cut through. Hence, press the cookie crumbs gently. Compress it but not too hard otherwise you will end up with some serious scratches on your plate.\nCan I set the cheesecake in the freezer?Freezing the cheesecake results in a hard base and filling. You won&#8217;t enjoy that. If you want the cheesecake to come out clean, just put it in the freezer for some time. If it gets frozen, leave it on the countertop or in the refrigerator till it is ready to eat.\n\n\n","instructions":"In a blender, add cookies and make crumbs.\nIn a large bowl, add cookie crumbs and coconut oil and mix well.

It is one of the most delicious burgers you will ever have. \n\nRajma Patty Burger with Mango Salsa\n\nTIPS TO MAKE IT RIGHT\n\n\nMoisture Content: Vegetables release a lot of moisture while cooking. Also, the potatoes can get very starchy, and difficult to make a firm patty. That is why it is important to balance the moisture content in the patties. You should be able to cook a perfectly shaped patty and it should not feel dry too. For that, add poha (rice flakes) or bread crumbs to the patty mixture. They will absorb the excess moisture and make a firm patty. But don&#8217;t add a lot of it otherwise the patty will become dry.\nResting Time: Make sure to use the boiled and cold potatoes. If you will mash the hot boiled potatoes, the mixture will become mushy and starchy. Even after making the mixture, refrigerate it. That will settle the starchiness of potatoes. Also, the poha or bread crumbs will absorb the excess moisture and make a firm patty.\nPatty Size: Don&#8217;t be tempted to make a big patty. The burger will just start to fall apart with each bite. Make sure the size of the patty is equal to the base of the burger bun. I am talking diameter here.\nLayering: Have you ever experience soggy buns? It is a total turn-off in burgers. That is why correct layering is important. Make sure that the buns are toasted well. It gives a nice crunch and prevents sogginess. Also, if you are using the store-bought burger sauce or mayonnaise, apply that first. The sauce contains oils that prevent moisture from getting into the bun. If you have homemade sauce or chutney, place the salad leaves first. \nBurger Sauce: To get a burst of flavors, apply sauce on both halves of the bun. If you miss the top half, it just feels tasteless. \n\n\nHOW TO SAVE THE RUINED MIXTURE?\n\nSometimes the ingredients behave differently. While following the exact recipe, the patty might not stay in shape while cooking. You will end up adding more oil to prevent it from sticking to the pan but that also doesn&#8217;t help. Or while shaping the patty, it creates a lot of cracks on its surface. Does this mean that the burgers are ruined? \n\nNot at all my dear friend.\n\nTOO MANY CRACKS\n\nIf while shaping, the patty forms a lot of cracks, chances are that the mixture is a little dry. Just mash an extra boiled potato in the mixture and mix it well. Roll the patty and it would be perfect. A few cracks while shaping is completely normal. \n\nSOGGY PATTY\n\nIf while cooking, the patty starts to become mushy and soggy, chances are that there is a lot of moisture in the mixture. Just add a little bit of extra poha (rice flakes) or bread crumbs to the mixture. Let it sit for a while and then cook the patties. It will be all right.\n\n\n\nNow grab all the ingredients because we are ready to make the juiciest and most flavorful veggie burger. I am sure you will love it as much as we do. If you try the recipe, make sure to share photos and tag us on Instagram &#8211; marriedfriends.\n\nBurger FAQsHow do you build a burger?First, toast the buns well. Then apply burger sauce or mayonnaise on both halves of the bun. The sauce contains oil which prevents the moisture from seeping into the buns. Place the salad leaf. On top of that goes your patty. Place raw onions or tomato slices and cover from the top bun. Insert a toothpick to hold everything together. If you have any other ingredient like fried onions or mango salsa etc. place it on top of the salad leaf. This way nothing falls when you take the bite.\nCan we store the burger patties?Yes. Of course. You can refrigerate it for around 5 days. You can also shape the patty and freeze them in an airtight container for up to a month. Just thaw them slightly before cooking.\nWhy my burger buns get soggy? How to fix that?Layering is important to prevent the sogginess of burger buns. Always apply the burger sauce or mayonnaise first. The sauce contains oils that prevent moisture from seeping into the buns and making them soggy. You can also place the salad leaf instead. If you are using a homemade sauce or chutney, do not apply them to the buns first. They contain moisture and will make the buns soggy.\nWhy my veggie patty gets mushy?Vegetables contain a lot of moisture that makes the patty soggy and mushy. It doesn&#8217;t hold the shape well while cooking. To prevent that, add binding ingredients like bread crumbs or poha (rice flakes). They absorb the excess moisture and helps the patty holding its shape. But do not add too much of it otherwise the patty will become dry.

Seriously. \n\nBefore you say anything, I know there are 6 ingredients but salt is a basic one. who counts that? 😀\n\n\n\nSince I started making cookies at home, I just don&#8217;t feel like buying them from the stores. Cookies are not just easy to bake at home but homemade cookies are much more delicious than store-bought ones. Moreover, they are fresh and you know what is going inside your body. No preservatives. No Stabilisers. No ingredient which is even hard to pronounce. \n\nIf you don&#8217;t have time, watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to make oats flour at home?\n\nFor this recipe, you can use store-bought oats flour too. But I prefer to make it at home using instant oats. Store-bought ones are a little expensive. Moreover, making it at home is quite easy and quick. Just grind the instant oats till you get a fine powder. A little bit of husk is fine. That will be separated out while sifting.\n\nTIPS TO BAKE IT RIGHT\n\n\nFlour: One most common question is &#8220;Can we replace the flour with some other one?&#8221;. Well of course. BUT you need to understand the texture of the dough we need to make the cookies. You can not replace just one ingredient and keep the rest of the recipe exactly the same. I would suggest following the same recipe first and then start making adjustments. \nSifting: Sifting dry ingredients is very important. Sometimes your sugar or flour contains some tiny lumps which are unnoticeable. But it gets difficult to form a smooth dough if they have any lumps. Especially, sugar lumps don&#8217;t dissolve while creaming it with butter. You will be able to see those lumps even in baked cookies. Hence, SIFT  DRY INGREDIENTS. \nRoom temperature ingredients: Make sure all the ingredients are at room temperature. If your butter, flour, etc. are in the refrigerator, take them out at least 1 hr before baking.\nCreaming: For how long should we cream the butter and sugar? More than the time, focus on the texture. Whisk it well till you see a light-colored, creamy, foamy texture. If you need the time, then whisk for around 2-4 minutes.\nFewer Cracks: This cookie develops cracks while making indents on it. To avoid that, DO NOT refrigerate the dough before making the balls. That just makes the mixture hard and will form more cracks. As soon as the dough is ready, make the balls and pat them gently using your fingers. And then use your thumb or the back of your finger to make indents on it. This way you will get fewer or no cracks at all.\n\n\nTHUMBPRINT COOKIE TEXTURE\n\nThese cookies are generally light in color. No browning at all. For that, you need to bake it at 160 degrees celsius for 15-18 minutes. I bake them for 20-25 minutes because I like them slightly brown. So, NO RULES. \n\nThese are soft but tender cookies. Totally, melt in the mouth. No one can eat just one.\n\nHOW TO STORE THESE COOKIES?\n\nThese cookies tend to get softer because of the jam in them. I would suggest finishing them in a day or two. Or if you are planning to bake a bigger batch and store it, then don&#8217;t fill the indents with jam while baking. Bake these thumbprint cookies without the jam. Store it in an airtight container. Fill the indents with your favorite jam while serving. This way, you can store it for a few days. But cookies always taste the best when they are fresh out of the oven. Isn&#8217;t it?\n\nJust keep these points in mind and now you are all ready to bake these tiny little drops of heaven. I am sure that the kids in your family will love it. Not just the kids, actually they are loved by everyone. Now, Grab all the ingredients and bake it today. If you enjoy the recipe, share a photo on Instagram and tag us too @marriedfriends.

Hence, the name. But let me tell you, making those indents with the back of your index finger is much easier. Really. Try that and you will know. Moreover, you can make slightly deeper holes from the back of your finger which means more jam too 😀\nWhy do my thumbprint cookies crack?Getting a few cracks in thumbprint cookies are kind of normal since you apply pressure on tiny cookie dough balls. But that can be prevented. Do not chill the dough because chilling the dough makes it harder and when you apply pressure, it forms cracks. As soon as the dough is ready, make small balls and then gently pat on them with your finger. Make them a little flat. Then make indents using your thumb. This prevents the formation of cracks in thumbprint cookies. If you still get fewer cracks, just smoothen them out using your fingers.\nWhy do my thumbprint cookies become soft?Because of the jam in thumbprint cookies, they become softer after a day or two. If you are baking a big batch, just bake without the jam, store them in an air-tight container. While serving, fill the cookies with your favorite jam.\nFor how long can we store thumbprint cookies?Thumbprint cookies get softer after a day or two because of the jam. They stay fresh, soft &amp; tender for 2 days. If you are baking a bigger batch, bake them without the jam. Store them in an air-tight container. Fill it with the jam while serving. Thay way, you can store them for a few days.\nIn thumbprint cookies, should we fill the jam before or after baking?In thumbprint cookies, you can fill the jam before baking. Just make sure not to over-fill otherwise the jam will start overflowing while baking. Fill the indents with 1/2 tsp of jam approx.\n\n\n","instructions":"Preheat oven to 160 degrees celsius, top/bottom setting.\nWhisk butter and sugar till they are light, creamy, and foamy.\nTo the creamed butter, add vanilla extract and mix it well. \nIn the same bowl, sift oats flour, and salt.

They taste the best when warm and fresh out of the oven. Imagine the chocolate melting in your mouth. Heavenly. And you can not have just one when these are homemade.</p>\n<p>It is a MUST TRY.</p>\n","content":"No cookie can beat the taste of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. They are warm, soft, chewy with a hint of crispiness and the chocolate that melts in your mouth &#8211; Heaven. And the aroma in the kitchen just takes you to some other world. Even writing about makes my mouth watery.\nSTORY TIME\nI wanted to bake these chocolate chip cookies since I saw that episode on FRIENDS where Monica baked a lot of cookies. Do you remember that Nestle Toll House cookie episode? Before that, I never had this kind of cookie which is softer. After watching the episode, I tried the chocolate cookies at Subway. They were different. Good but just too sweet for my taste buds. And they were soft and chewy. Something that I experienced for the first time. I liked that.\nWhen we bought our microwave and I baked these cookies at home, I fell in love. That was Love at First Bite. They taste so good when they are warm and fresh out of the oven. Although, Jatin likes to cool them completely first. When he had it for the first time, he thought these are not well cooked. Because they were not crispy and crunchy like other cookies. It took him some time to digest the fact that these cookies are supposed to be soft and chewy.\nIf you don&#8217;t have time, watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nTIPS TO BAKE IT RIGHT\n\nFlour: One most common question is “Can we replace the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour?”. Well of course. BUT you need to understand the texture of the dough we need to make the cookies. You can not replace just one ingredient and keep the rest of the recipe exactly the same. Whole wheat flour absorbs more moisture than all-purpose flour. And if you keep other ingredients the same, you will end up with dry dough &amp; hence a dry cookie. I would suggest following the same recipe first and then start making adjustments.\nSifting: Sifting dry ingredients is very important. Sometimes your sugar or flour contains some tiny lumps which are unnoticeable. And it gets difficult to form a smooth dough if they have any lumps. Especially, sugar lumps don’t dissolve while creaming it with butter. You will be able to see those lumps even in baked cookies. Hence, SIFT DRY INGREDIENTS.\nRoom temperature ingredients: Make sure all the ingredients are at room temperature. If your butter, flour, etc. are in the refrigerator, take them out at least 1 hr before baking.\nCreaming: For how long should we cream the butter and sugar? More than the time, focus on the texture. Whisk it well till you see a light-colored, creamy, foamy texture. If you need the time, then whisk for around 5 to 7 minutes.\nFreezing: Refrigerating the dough is important to get the right shape of the cookie. If you won&#8217;t chill the dough, the cookies will spread too much and become flat. Also, freezing the dough makes the cookie chewy. \n\nCHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE TEXTURE\nThese cookies are soft &amp; chewy from the inside and slightly crispy from the outside. Brown Sugar not just gives a different taste to these cookies but also makes them softer. Chilling the dough makes them chewy. The longer the freezing time, the chewier will be the cookies.\nHow TO MAKE IT CRISPY?\nIf you like your chocolate chip cookies crispy or less chewy, just replace brown sugar with regular white sugar. Do not add corn starch. Bake for a little longer till you get the desired crispiness. I did not make these cookies crispy because we like it soft now but I am sure this will work. \nHOW TO STORE THESE COOKIES?\nThe best thing about this cookie dough is that you can freeze the dough for up to a month. Make small balls, put them in an air-tight container, and freeze. Whenever you are craving, just take out a few pieces, thaw them a little, and bake. You can even refrigerate the dough for up to 7 days.\nFor baked cookies, put them in an air-tight container and you can store them for 2-3 days. Although, I would suggest baking it fresh. \nNow you are all ready to bake these delicious chocolate chip cookies. Grab all the ingredients and bake them today.

Cookies flatten if you won&#8217;t chill the dough. Chilling the dough makes the butter solid and while baking, it takes time to melt and hence gives a thick and sturdy cookie. Also, if you are using a greased pan, cookies will spread as there is no friction to prevent them from spreading. Reusing the same tray to bake another batch of cookies could also be the reason. Sometimes, even after following every guideline, if they flatten, maybe it is not the best cookie day. But they will still taste very good. Enjoy.\nWhat makes chocolate chip cookies soft &amp; chewy?Brown sugar in chocolate chip cookies contains molasses which is a softener. If you replace sugar with honey or maple syrup, they also make these cookies soft. The time and temperature of baking also contribute to a softer cookie. They become chewy because of freezing the dough. The longer the chilling time, the chewier will be the cookies.\nWhat makes cookies tough and hard?The most common reason for hard and tough cookies is over mixing the dough. Mix the cookie dough only till you don&#8217;t see any dry flour left in the bowl. Also, using a spatula to mix prevents gluten formation. Mixing the dough with hands may result in kneading the dough. If this forms too much gluten, you will get a tough cookie.\nWhy my cookies are dry?If there is too much flour in the dough, the cookies become dry and they don&#8217;t taste good. To prevent that, measure all the dry and wet ingredients carefully. If after measuring everything accurately the dough still feels dry, add a little bit of extra liquid &#8211; 1 Tbsp at a time.\nHow to bake cookies without oven/microwave?This is one question we get asked a lot. There are a lot of things that you can try.\n\nPressure Cooker Oven &#8211; Heat salt or sand in your pressure cooker. Then place a ring and on top of that comes a plate/tray for baking cookies. Leave some space in between the cookies as they spread. Cover the pressure cooker without the rubber and whistle. Cook for a few minutes. Check and remove once they are perfectly cooked.\nCast Iron Kadhai &#8211; It works the same as the pressure cooker. Just cover it up with a lid. Seal it well. It will work like an oven.\nIdli Stand &#8211; This is the easiest of all the methods. Put the cookies on each mould of the idli stand and cook them without any water or steam. It turns out absolutely good.\n\nHope that these methods will work for you. Happy baking.\n\n","instructions":"In a bowl, add butter, white sugar, and brown sugar.

And still, these banana walnut muffins (or cupcakes) are extremely soft and moist. The best thing is that they remain like that even on the next day. These muffins taste good when they are just out of the oven &#8211; fresh &amp; warm. But just wait for a few minutes because we don&#8217;t want to burn our mouth. I know it can be hard but we got to be strong for the love of Banana Walnut Muffins 🙂\n\nSTORY TIME\n\nWe both love banana walnut muffins a lot. I mean there is something in this combination that makes it so addictive and irresistible. When we got our oven, we baked these muffins almost every weekend. We used to make a batch thinking that it would last for the week but they never survived that long. We used to finish them in a day or two max. And it&#8217;s just the two of us. We ate a lot. \n\nThen I thought of making these muffins healthy so that we can eat them guilt-free. And oh my. I can not believe that even without eggs, maida (all-purpose flour), butter, sugar these muffins taste so good &#8211; soft and moist. Just the way we love it. I make them with oat flour to make them even healthier and gluten-free. I am very excited to share this recipe with you. Give it a try and I am sure you will love it as much as we do.\n\nIf you don&#8217;t have time, watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to make oat flour at home?\n\nFor this recipe, you can use store-bought oats flour too. But I prefer to make it at home using instant oats. Store-bought ones are a little expensive. Moreover, making it at home is quite easy and quick. Just grind the instant oats till you get a fine powder. A little bit of husk is fine. That will be separated out while sifting.\n\nTIPS TO BAKE IT RIGHT\n\n\nRoom Temperature: Make sure that all the ingredients are at&nbsp;room temperature. Plan it ahead so that you have enough time to take your butter, curd, lemons out of the refrigerator and let them sit on the counter for a while.\nMeasure Accurately: Correctly measuring the ingredients is very important. Adding extra flour is one common mistake. Just fill your measuring cup with the flour and then level it off with a knife. If the wet ingredients are not measured well, the muffins will become soggy.\nSifting: Sift the dry ingredients &#8211; flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt. This ensures that there are no lumps in the batter. \nOver mixing: This is something that happens accidentally. Over mixing crushes all the air bubbles and you end with dense muffins. To ensure that the muffins are light, airy, and fluffy, mix the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients until they are just combined. That means you don’t see any dry ingredients left in the bowl.\nLeavening Agent: Baking Powder and Baking Soda&nbsp;help the muffins rise. Double-check to make sure it has not expired.\n\n\nADJUSTMENTS &#8211; YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE\n\n\nWet ingredients: The mashed banana makes these muffins soft and moist. This recipe calls for 2 large bananas. When mashed, they measure 3/4 Cup. If the bananas you are using are slightly smaller, you can add any vegan milk or dairy milk of your choice. I add oat milk and it works absolutely fine. \nMilk: You can use any milk &#8211; dairy or vegan. If you feel that after mixing, the dough looks dry, add a little bit of milk to adjust the consistency of the batter.\nNut Butter: You can use any nut butter &#8211; peanut butter, almond butter, or cashew butter. I prefer almond or cashew since peanut butter gives a very strong flavor to these muffins and we don&#8217;t like that. But it is all your choice. \nSweetener: I added maple syrup to these muffins. But you can even add agave syrup or honey to it. Adjust the sweetness as per your taste. The quantity of sweetener will vary depending on the sweetness of the bananas used. Also, these liquid sweeteners make the muffins softer.\nFlour: You can use whole wheat flour, almond flour, or any other flour in this recipe. But you need to understand the texture of the batter needed. Every flour has a different liquid-absorbing capacity. Hence, you can not just change one ingredient and keep the rest of the ingredients the same. I would suggest you try the same recipe first and then start making adjustments. Also, the texture of the muffins may change with different flours. \n\n\nHOW TO STORE THESE MUFFINS?\n\nYou can store these muffins (or cupcakes) in an air-tight container. Leave them at the room temperature for a day or two. Refrigerate them for a few more days. If you like them warm, just reheat while serving. If you live in a colder place, you can even store them at the room temperature for 2-4 days.\n\nNow we are all ready to bake these delicious banana walnut muffins. You can enjoy these over dessert, breakfast, or as a snack. The kids in the family are going to love it and you can even make them eat oats through these muffins. Jatin doesn&#8217;t like oats so I keep creating different oats recipes for him. For example, you may want to try these oats thumbprint cookies.

It is warm, comforting and you just can&#8217;t have enough of it. It&#8217;s one recipe that&#8217;s perfect for every mood, every occasion. </p>\n","content":"\nA little bit of tanginess. A hint of sweetness. And lots of flavors. When these three things combine, then we get a delicious Punjabi rajma (kidney bean). This is literally a true love for everyone. If you don&#8217;t know about True Love &#8211; Try Rajma Chawal. \n\nSTORY TIME\n\nMy husband is a Punjabi and I am from Uttar Pradesh. Both of us love Rajma Chawal a lot. And both of us had a very different kind of rajma while growing up. In my home, we used to have a slightly sweeter rajma. But not like those sweet gravies/curries which you get in Gujarat. On the other hand, Jatin&#8217;s mom makes it very simple, with more tomatoes and less onion, and fewer spices. Both were absolutely different in taste and both are undoubtedly delicious.\n\nWhen we got married and made Rajma for each other, we just couldn&#8217;t enjoy it as much as we did earlier. Making two different versions of rajma as per our individual liking was off the table. Then I started experimenting more with Rajma to get the taste that we both can enjoy. It took several attempts but finally, I did it. Now Jatin loves my rajma so much that sometimes he even licks the plate. Yay. It has a hint of sweetness that he doesn&#8217;t mind and a little bit of sourness I love. That&#8217;s the secret of our happy marriage &#8211; A Perfect Rajma 😀\n\nIf you don&#8217;t have time, watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIPS TO MAKE IT RIGHT\n\n\nSoaking Rajma: I always prefer to wash the kidney beans/rajma first and then soak it overnight. If you soak it first and then wash, the red color of rajma also washes out. Hence, wash it well 2-3 times and then soak (with 3 inches higher water) overnight or for at least 6-8 hrs. If you don&#8217;t have much time, soak it in hot water for 1 hour.\nBoiling Rajma: The rajma should be boiled perfectly. It should be soft enough that you can easily press it with your fingers. The water level is very important while boiling. If the water is not enough, the skin of rajma will come off and it will become mushy and won&#8217;t look good. Keep the water level at least 2-3 inches above the level of Rajma.\nBrown Onions: Make sure that the onions get completely brown while sautéing. It should not be burnt. Add a little bit of water to avoid burning. Browning of onions caramelizes them and makes them slightly sweeter.  It tastes very good in Rajma.\nGravy Color: To get a nice red color gravy, add red chili powder and turmeric powder (haldi) with tomato puree itself. It cooks for a long time and gives a very nice color to the gravy.\nGravy Consistency: The gravy thickens as it cools down. Hence, keep the consistency depending on when are you going to eat it.\n\n\nADJUSTMENTS &#8211; YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE\n\n\nOnion Paste: In the recipe, I used chopped onions but you can also make a paste of it.\nTomato Puree: If you don&#8217;t have a grinder, you can also grate the tomatoes using a grater. The gravy will turn out just nice.\nGhee: If you are a vegan, replace ghee with an equal amount of any cooking oil.\nRajma: You can even use canned rajma but make sure they don&#8217;t have sugar added to it. It makes the rajma quite sweet. \n\n\nNow let&#8217;s grab all the ingredients because we are ready to make one delicious meal &#8211; Rajma Chawal. Make it for lunch or brunch over the weekends. It is quite easy, healthy, and like I said &#8211; A True Love. By the way, if you never tried rajma with aalu paratha, try it with the leftover rajma. It tastes so very good. \n\nIf you try this recipe, please share the photos on Instagram and tag us too @marriedfriends.

You must try it. </p>\n","content":"\nNo Deep Frying. No Baking. &amp; No Compromise on the taste. That was my challenge when I decided to healthify one of our favorite street foods &#8211; Vada Pav. If you think that this recipe can not match the taste of what you eat outside, in Maharashtra &#8211; Try it. Be ready to be blown away. With your eyes closed, you won&#8217;t be able to tell the difference if it is deep-fried or made with our healthy twist. \n\nWhat is Vada Pav?\n\nVada Pav is one of the most popular street foods in Maharashtra. Those who tried it loved it. I heard that people living in Mumbai literally survive on this one recipe. It is cheap, easily available, filling, and gives you the energy to keep up with the pace of Mumbai.\n\nIt is basically vadas &#8211; deep-fried potato fritters &#8211; sandwiched between the pav (dinner rolls) and layers of chutneys. You can enjoy it throughout the year, any time of the day, but for me, it complements well with the rainy season. Having vada pav with some garma garam chai (hot cup of tea) on the streets during monsoon season is a treat in itself. It never fails to excite you. \n\nSTORY TIME\n\nWe are from Delhi and moved to Pune, Maharashtra since we got married. That time we used to go to the same place every Friday and have vada pav with chai. We did this for a few months. Then that small shop got closed down. We were very sad seeing that. But then life has to move on. We found another place for our love of vada pav. \n\nThat time vada pav was so easily accessible that I never thought of making it at home. But when we moved to Germany, we started craving for vada pav so much. Maybe because of the lovely weather here. I had no option but to make it at home. If you know me, you know that I just don&#8217;t like to deep fry anything if I can manage without it. When I told Jatin that I am going to make the Non-Fried Vada Pav, he had his own doubts about it. But when he had it, he said that he can&#8217;t even tell if it is deep-fried or not. The taste was exactly like we used to eat on the streets in Pune, Maharashtra. Yay. A victory for me. \n\nIf you don&#8217;t have much time, watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPONENTS OF VADA PAV\n\nWe lived in Maharashtra for 6 years and tried vada pav of so many different cities there. Every place has its own version of vada pav. Some sell it very simple &#8211; vada, pav, and sukha (dry) garlic chutney. Some add the chura (fried drops of the batter). Chura adds a nice crunch to the vada pav. Some sell it with green chutney, red chutney, schezwan chutney, peri peri chutney. I mean the variations are endless. Of all, our favorite has to be the simple vada pav. No Fuss. \n\nFor this recipe, you need to prepare the following:\n\n\nBatata Vada: This is the backbone of vada pav. It is made of boiled potatoes and some very basic spices. In this recipe, instead of deep-frying, I coated the balls with the batter and cooked them on a pan with just a little bit of oil. DO NOT worry, the vada or the balls get cooked from all the sides. Gram Flour doesn&#8217;t need a lot of heat to cook. Just cover the pan and you are sorted. \nDry Chutney: This is the soul of vada pav. Without this sukha chutney, it feels incomplete. I tried different styles of chutney for vada pav but the one which I shared here gives the most authentic taste. The chutney feels a little moist after grinding. But it gets dry when you put it in a bowl (uncovered).\nGreen Chilli: Fried chili and vada pav go hand in hand. But it is my recipe so obviously, the green chili won&#8217;t be deep-fried. You actually don&#8217;t need to do that. Green chilies cook in no time. You can add them in the same pan with the vadas, cover, and cook. It gets cooked in less than a minute.\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO STORE?\n\nYou can make the mixture, store it in an air-tight container and refrigerate for 4-5 days. The dry chutney can last for a few weeks on the countertop. Or you can put it in the refrigerator too. \n\nNow grab all the ingredients because we are ready to make these Non-Fried Vada Pav at home. Everybody in your family will be blown away by the taste. I am sure they will enjoy it as much as we do. Make it with your evening tea &amp; enjoy this delicious treat over snacks. Or if you are like us, eat a little extra so that you are sorted for the dinner too.\n\nIf you try this recipe, please share the photos on Instagram and tag us too @marriedfriends.

It depends on our relationship with the food. Overconsumption of healthy food can also harm your body. Thinking about calories, carbs, weight gain, etc. while having a vada pav will affect your mental health too. It means that you do not have a good relationship with the food you are having. Enjoy your food not just for your physical health but also for your mental health too.\nTalking about vada pav, it is made of boiled potatoes with some tempering, and then it is coated with gram flour and deep fried. If you don&#8217;t want to have deep fried food, you can make our non-fried vada pav too. Trust me. There is no compromise on the taste. You will love it.\nWhat is vada pav?Vada Pav is popular street food in Maharashtra. It is basically vadas – deep-fried potato fritters – sandwiched between the pav (dinner rolls) and layers of chutneys.

Just vadas and pav and you are good to go. But to enhance the taste even more, you can have it with some dry garlic chutney, green dhaniya chutney, red tamarind chutney. Indian Chai goes very well with vada pav.

But what if you can enjoy the leftover the next day, with the same or even more excitement? Isn&#8217;t it double happiness with a single recipe? Do try this creamy, crunchy, delicious Rajma Wrap. </p>\n","content":"\nCall it a roll, a wrap, or a Frankie &#8211; Your choice. But you have to try this delicious, flavourful, and very different wrap recipe. I can guarantee you that after having this, you will stop buying wraps from restaurants. It is creamy, crunchy, a little sweet, a little sour, and a lot tasty. Perfect for a quick lunch or dinner and even for a delightful weekend brunch. \n\nSTORY TIME\n\nLet me share how we discovered this wrap. \n\nDo you know Faasos &#8211; an Indian online food service? One day, we decided to order food online. We started looking at the menu of Faasos. They had very exciting veg wraps on their menu. I only remember Dal Makhani though because that is what we ordered and it was extremely delicious. I don&#8217;t know if they still have those wraps. \n\nDuring the COVID lockdown time, we started craving those wraps. But since we were not ordering anything at that time, we have one option left &#8211; make it at home. Not only we tried dal makhani wrap at home but also made some wraps with leftover rajma (kidney bean curry) &amp; chhole (chickpea curry). All three wraps were extremely delicious. Since then, whenever we make these curries at home, we always make some extra so that we can have these wraps the next day. \n\nOne more thing which we tried in this recipe is hung curd. It is such a good replacement for sour cream. It tastes exactly the same. So you don&#8217;t need any sour cream. Just hang some yogurt in a cloth for a few hours and you are good to go. You can also try hung curd dip. Recipe of the same shared in dal makhani wrap.\n\nIf you don&#8217;t have time, watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPONENTS OF VEG KIDNEY BEAN WRAP\n\nYou can be as creative as you want. You can make your own adjustments to this recipe. This recipe is quite forgiving. You don&#8217;t need to stick to the exact recipe. Just follow your heart 🙂\n\nBut below are the preparation you need to do for this recipe:\n\n\nPunjabi Rajma Masala: I already have the recipe for it. You can check it out here. We need thick rajma masala for this recipe otherwise it will be difficult to fill it in the wrap. Generally, rajma masala gets thicker by the next day but if you still have a lot of curry in your rajma masala, just strain it using a sieve. A little curry is all right because that will be evaporated while making the wrap filling. \nBaked Potatoes: It is the soul of this wrap. We tried it randomly one day with one of our wraps and it just changed the game of that recipe altogether. It tasted so good that since then we add baked potatoes in every wrap we make. You must try it. \nFresh Salad: Salad adds a nice crunch and freshness to the wraps. You can add any salad vegetable you like &#8211; onion, tomato, avocado, celery, bell peppers, olives, radish, greens. I add them all. Especially Avocados. They add a nice creaminess to this wrap. \nHung Curd: We don&#8217;t like to use mayonnaise or any other spread for these wraps. Hung curd goes very well with most wraps. Just hang some yogurt/curd in a cloth or a regular sieve which we use to strain the tea. Leave it like that at least for 1 hour so that it becomes all thick and creamy. If you don&#8217;t have time, just hang it when you start your preparation. \n\n\n\n\nADJUSTMENTS &#8211; YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE\n\n\nTortilla: You can make this wrap using a store-bought tortilla or you can make tortillas at home too. You can even use whole wheat chapati/roti or paratha. Just make sure to make it slightly bigger in size so that it will be easier to roll it well.\nSauce: I like the sauce which is slightly sweeter in taste. But you can use any sauce or even tomato ketchup in this recipe. If you don&#8217;t want, you can skip it too.\nHung Curd: I use hung curd because it is easily available and always in my home. But you can even use sour cream in place of the hung curd. \nBaked Potatoes: Sure. You can make this recipe using pan-fried potatoes too. But it will be different. The different cooking method changes the taste and the texture. We love it with baked potatoes. I would suggest that try it with that too. \n\n\nHOW TO STORE IT?\n\nI always make it fresh but if you want to make a big batch and store it, you can do that. Just make the wraps, put them in an air tight container and store them in your freezer for a few weeks. When you want to eat it, just heat them well and enjoy. \n\nIf you don&#8217;t feel like having wraps, you can try our other kidney bean/rajma recipes &#8211; Punjabi Rajma Masala or Rajma Patty Burger with Mango Salsa. Both the recipes are delicious.\n\nNow grab all the ingredients and let&#8217;s make some exciting rajma wraps from the leftover rajma masala. If you have kids, imagine how many veggies you can make them eat in one serving. Right? \n\nI hope you will love this vegetarian, simple, delicious rajma/kidney bean wrap recipe.

No Cream Cheese. No Sugar. &amp; Not even biscuits. Oh, I forgot, no gelatine or agar agar too. What is it made of then? My friend let me present a very different, healthy yet tasty creamy cheesecake to you. And this is one more recipe that I made using oats. Yes. This cheesecake has got oats and nuts crust. Surprraaiizzzz 😀\n\nBy the way, have you tried our vegan mango mini cheesecake? You Must. It is very delicious &amp; refreshing and the combination of mango and coconut is just so drool-worthy.\n\nSTORY TIME\n\nA few days back, I was watching the recipe video of Chef Ranveer Brar. He posted a very delicious strawberry cheesecake. It made me crave strawberry cheesecake with some chocolate sauce on top. Ahhh I am drooling. I decided to make it the next day itself. But you know me. I always try to make healthier versions of the recipes. I didn&#8217;t have biscuits and I was too lazy to bake some or buy some. And then I decided to substitute biscuits with the oats and nuts combination. \n\nAlthough, the nuts and oats make a little heavy base. The biscuit base feels lighter somehow. But if you want a healthier option then you can surely try this. The roasted nuts and oats taste quite nice. Moreover, this way you can have your oats the tasty way too. Isn&#8217;t it exciting? \n\nIf you are in a hurry, watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDO WE NEED GELATINE/AGAR AGAR?\n\nIf you don’t know, gelatine is a non-vegetarian food item. It is made from the skin of animals. If you are a vegetarian, you can use agar agar. These days you can even get vegetarian or vegan gelatine too.\n\nThis cheesecake does not have any cream cheese, heavy cream, gelatine, eggs, or cornstarch. These are the ingredients that help in setting the cheesecake.&nbsp;After trying my hands on cheesecakes, I realized that you don’t need gelatine or agar agar to set the filling. If you have the correct proportion of fat and moisture in the filling, it will set perfectly. If I can do it with the vegan filling or the filling with no cream cheese, I assume that it will be a lot easier with the regular cream cheese filling. I still had to try that. But after having these healthy cheesecakes, I have no plans to try that as of now. Moreover, these cheesecakes are quite light and ‘Summery’. You can have more than one and won’t feel sick at all.\n\nBut you will need the gelatine if you want that shiny, fruity, gel-like layer on top of your cheesecake. \n\nAlso, if you are living in a place with a very hot climate, chances are that your cheesecake will start to melt as soon as they come out of the refrigerator. In that case, gelatine or agar agar helps to keep it set at room temperature. \n\n\n\nTIPS TO MAKE IT RIGHT\n\n\nDo not press the cookie crumbs too hard. They become dense and it will be tough to cut them with a spoon. Just Apply&nbsp;medium pressure and level the base/crust.\nDo not add&nbsp;water/milk to blend the filling mixture. Remember, we need to maintain the fat and moisture ratio.\nLemon Juice&nbsp;is added to give sourness that is there in regular cheesecakes.\nIf they don’t come out clean, put them in the&nbsp;freezer for 15-20 minutes. Don’t worry. They won’t become hard. Even if they do, put them back in the refrigerator. They will be all right.\nIt is hard to&nbsp;wait for it to set. But have some patience. Let it sit overnight or for at least 8 hrs in the refrigerator. If you keep it overnight, it becomes more flavourful.\nServe&nbsp;refrigerated. They start to melt and become very soft at room temperature. So, always serve them straight from the refrigerator.\n\n\nADJUSTMENTS &#8211; YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE\n\n\nCrust/Base: You can use any biscuit instead of oats and nuts. Just grind them well. You can add peanuts, pistachios, hazelnut, or any nut of your choice. Although, we didn&#8217;t like peanuts much but you can give it a try.\nSweetener: I used maple syrup in the base and filling. But you can add agave syrup, dates syrup, or honey to sweeten the cheesecake. \nFilling: You can make the filling with some heavy cream too instead of adding cashews and hung curd. Hung Curd gives it a nice, mildly sour flavor too. If you are making paneer/cottage cheese at home, make it with full-fat milk.\nStrawberry Puree: I made fresh strawberry puree for this recipe. But you can add the store-bought strawberry sauce too. You can even add strawberry jam to the filling mixture. It will give it a nice taste and color too. But just make sure to adjust the sweetener because store-bought puree and jams already contain sugar.\n\n\nIf you want to make it vegan, follow the vegan mango mini cheesecake recipe for the filling. Just replace the mango puree with the strawberry puree. That&#8217;s it. Here is our mango mini cheesecake for your reference.\n\n\n\nTOPPINGS\n\nYou can enjoy these as is or garnish with some beautiful toppings like:\n\n\nStrawberry slices and mint leaves\nStrawberry Puree (which we made for this recipe)\nWhipped Cream\nStrawberry sauce\nChocolate Shavings\nLemon Zest\nAny sour fruit or berries\n\n\nNow grab all the ingredients because we are ready to set our cheesecakes.

We love to see your creation of our recipes.\n\nLove from us\n\nRicha &amp; Jatin\n\nCheesecakeWhy did my No-Bake cheesecake not set?For no-bake cheesecakes to set perfectly, it needs to have the right amount of fat and moisture in the filling. If it has a lot of moisture, it will be difficult to set it. Apart from that, refrigerate it for at least 4 hrs, if not overnight.\nWill my cheesecake set if it is runny?If your cheesecake filling is too runny, it will take more time to set in the refrigerator. Even after keeping it overnight, it doesn&#8217;t set, increase the quantity of fat in the filling the next time you try it.\nHow long should you chill cheesecake?A minimum of 4 hrs is needed to set it perfectly but preferably overnight. keeping it overnight also develops more flavour to the cheesecake.\nWhy is the base of cheesecake too hard?If you compress the cookie crumbs too hard in the baking tin, it will become difficult to cut them with a spoon or a fork. When you chill the base in the refrigerator, it becomes dense and too hard to cut through. Hence, press the cookie crumbs gently. Compress it but not too hard otherwise you will end up with some serious scratches on your plate.\nCan I set the cheesecake in the freezer?Freezing the cheesecake results in a hard base and filling. You won&#8217;t enjoy that. If you want the cheesecake to come out clean, just put it in the freezer for some time. If it gets frozen, leave it on the countertop or in the refrigerator till it is ready to eat.\n\n\n","instructions":"Add oats, almonds, and walnuts in a grinder and grind till you get a fine mixture.\nTake it out in a bowl.

It is a foolproof recipe for someone like me &#8211; who tried making dosa so many times and always failed and eventually gave up. But now I can make dosa even with my eyes closed. Okay, that&#8217;s an exaggeration but you got my point. Right? \n\nWe also have the recipe of Instant Ragi Dosa. Ragi is Finger Millet in English. Ragi Dosa is not just healthy but quite delicious too. And like I always say, make millets a part of your kitchen, your diet. They are very nutritious, rich in fibers, and gluten-free too. \n\nInstant and Crispy Ragi Dosa\n\nSTORY TIME\n\nI never met anyone who doesn&#8217;t love dosa. Except for my South Indian friend who used to have it almost every day and got bored of it. I was a dosa lover since childhood and used to go to my South Indian friend&#8217;s home to have all kinds of South Indian delicacies. I even learned to make dosa from his mom. But man, it was an impossible task for me.\n\nThen I married a huge dosa fan. Since we both found making dosa so difficult, we always used to go out to eat dosa. You can easily get a good dosa in Indian restaurants but sometimes you have to compromise on the taste of sambar or chutney. I was okay with that but my huge dosa fan husband wanted to make it just perfect at home. I gave up after many attempts but then the lockdown came. We stopped eating out and we had no option left but to make it at home. \n\n&amp; Finally, we did it. We found a foolproof recipe. \n\nNow we can make dosa anytime we want. These days we are having it once or twice every week. Yay. I was so excited that I decided to share this recipe with everyone who had been through the same situation as I did. So get ready to enjoy a restaurant-style dosa at home.\n\nIf you don&#8217;t have time, watch the video instead and if you enjoy it, please Subscribe to our Youtube channel too. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIPS TO MAKE IT RIGHT\n\n\nGrind Sooji: Earlier I tried to make dosa using sooji rava because that&#8217;s how I used to make uttapam and Gordon Ramsay&#8217;s Potato Pancake. Sooji does get soft when you make the batter and let it rest for a while. But it doesn&#8217;t give the right texture and crispiness needed for a dosa. Grinding sooji into a fine powder is important. \nPoha or Rice Flour: I also grind some poha/rice flakes along with the sooji. You can also use rice flour instead. This ingredient gives nice crispiness to the dosa.\nWhole Wheat Flour: The dosa batter needs a good binding agent that can make it spread well on the pan. Whole wheat flour helps in making a thin dosa. \nSugar: Don&#8217;t worry. Sugar won&#8217;t make the dosa sweet. It helps in giving a nice restaurant-style browning to the dosa. It also enhances the flavor of the dosa. \nBatter Consistency: More than the right kind of pan, you need to have the right consistency of the batter. It is THE MOST IMPORTANT thing. It should neither be thick nor thin otherwise it will be difficult to spread it on the pan. You need a medium consistency batter. \nHeat: Heat on the pan also plays a major role in making a perfect dosa. If the pan is too hot, you won&#8217;t be able to spread the batter. It will start sticking to the pan and will form lumps. That&#8217;s why keep the flame on medium, sprinkle water at the start, and before making each dosa. This reduces the temperature of the pan. Wipe off the water and then pour the batter and spread it. You will get good results. \nOil: I always used to think that oiling the pan is important because that will prevent sticking the batter to the pan. NEVER EVER DO IT. Learn from my mistakes. The oil prevents the easy spreading of the batter. \n\n\nWHAT CAN RUIN THE DOSA?\n\nTwo things that can really ruin your dosa-making experience are Curd and Baking Soda. \n\nIf your curd is sitting in the fridge for a long time, chances are that your dosa will become soggy. It happens. It is tough to explain the texture but it just ruins the mood.\n\nAlso, if the baking soda has expired, you won&#8217;t get a light, airy batter. The texture of the dosa also changes because of that. But you can check the quality of baking soda. Just add a little bit of lemon juice to it. If it forms bubbles, it means your baking soda is just perfect. If not, it is time to buy a new pack.\n\nWHAT GOES WELL WITH DOSA?\n\nHonestly, sometimes I don&#8217;t need anything with dosa. Just some paper-thin dosa and a cup of coffee (vegan). I am sorted. But if you want to enjoy it fully, serve it with the following:\n\n\nSambar (in the video)\nOnion-Tomato Chutney (in the video)\nCoconut Chutney (in the video)\nCoconut Coriander Chutney (in the video)\n\n\nTo have the best experience, serve it hot. It doesn&#8217;t remain crispy if you let it rest. Also, the masala makes it softer quickly. Although, I like soft dosa too. Loved it when someone used to bring it in school 😀\n\nI think I shared all my learnings here and I am sure now you will be able to make a perfect instant dosa at home. Don&#8217;t get disheartened if it is slightly thick in your first attempt. It will get better with each dosa you make. The best thing about instant dosa is that you can make it anytime. It is perfect for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. You don&#8217;t need to soak anything or wait for the batter to ferment. Just whip up the ingredients and it&#8217;s ready.\n\nNow grab all the ingredients because you are ready to make restaurant-style dosa at home.

It is made of sooji and curd and perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner too.\nHow to make a crispy dosa at home?If you are making instant dosa using sooji or semolina, add 2 Tbsp of rice four in the batter. That will make the dosa much crispy. Do not add a lot of rice flour because it will ruin the texture of the dosa.\nWhy my dosa sticks to the pan?Dosa sticking to the pan is a very common problem. You can avoid that by the following ways:\n\nMake sure the pan is not very hot. To keep the pan at the required temperature, sprinkle some water and wipe it off after making each dosa.\nDo not apply oil to the pan. It becomes difficult to spread the dosa and it just keeps sticking to the ladle.\nMaybe your dosa batter is quite thick. Add a little bit of water and whisk it well.\n\nIf you are a beginner in making dosa, I would suggest trying with a non-stick pan first and when you get better, you can try your hands on a cast iron pan.\nWhy my dosa is not spreading on the pan?If your dosa is not spreading well on the pan, maybe your dosa batter is slightly thick. To correct that, add a little bit of water and whisk it well. The batter should not be thick or thin. Both ruin the dosa-making experience. Make sure the batter is of medium consistency which is easy to pour and easy to spread.\nHow do you evenly spread dosa?One mistake to avoid is &#8211; DO NOT apply oil on the pan. It prevents the spreading of the batter.\nMake sure the pan is not very hot. Sprinkle some water and wipe it off after making each dosa. If the pan is too hot, the batter will start cooking as soon as you pour it.\nTo spread it evenly, pour around half a ladle (depends on the size of the pan) at the center of the pan and start spreading it out in circular motion starting from the center. Do not apply a lot of pressure. Do not rush. One common mistake that we all do is that we rush in spreading and that just ruins it. Stay calm and spread it gently. It may be thick in the beginning but it will get better with each dosa you make.\n\n","instructions":"Heat some oil in a pan and then add mustard seeds, chana dal, urad dal.

Yes. There is no shortcut to that. Just have patience and make this delicious recipe at home. </p>\n<p>It is a Show Stealer. </p>\n","content":"\nWhen I say that it is Dhaba style dal makhani, I mean that it is Delhi&#8217;s Dhaba Style Dal Makhani. That is the best. Literally. It is creamy, flavourful, &amp; just absolutely drool-worthy. And with this recipe, you can have the same experience at home too. \n\nAlso, make it a little extra so that with the leftover dal makhani, you can make our delicious dal makhani wraps too. One dish, two recipes. Wao.\n\nSTORY TIME\n\nWe both are from Delhi. We both are vegetarians. That means every birthday, every anniversary, or every special occasion at home was celebrated with dal makhani. Literally. In both our families, dal makhani, some kind of paneer recipe, and naan used to be our go-to meal whenever we ordered food from outside. No celebration was complete without these food items. \n\nThen we grew up, we got married, shared our love for dal makhani with each other, and then moved to Pune. There we just couldn&#8217;t find that same taste of dal makhani in any Dhaba or restaurant. And like always, I had no option left but to make it at home. And we did it. We got the same taste in our homemade dal makhani too. That was a big celebratory moment. And like always we celebrated with dal makhani. Since then, we have never ordered dal makhani from outside. Homemade is always the best. Right?\n\nIf you don&#8217;t have time, watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSECRET OF DAL MAKHANI\n\nYou may think that the creaminess of dal makhani comes from adding a lot of cream or butter to it. That is not true. I mean, you need that but that is not the only thing to get that rich and creamy texture. The secret is &#8211; SLOW COOKING. That&#8217;s right my friend. There is no shortcut to that. You have to have patience, a lot of it while making this delicious recipe. \n\nHow Slow Cooking helps?\n\nWell, the dal which we use in this recipe &#8211; urad dal (whole) or urad chilka &#8211; gets very starchy and creamy when you cook it for a very long time. The more you cook, the more creamy it gets. In many restaurants or dhabas, by the end of the day, when they are done with making naan or roti on the tandoor, they put this dal on it and leave it to cook overnight. Dal cooks slowly on hot coal for the entire night and that is how you get that rich and creamy texture in it. \n\nBut obviously, you can&#8217;t do that at home. Although, my Instant Pot has an option of slow cooking which I will try one day. I slow cook this dal in two parts. First, when I pressure cook urad dal and rajma together. After a whistle in the pressure cooker, I cook it on the lowest flame for another 40 to 50 minutes till it gets well cooked and mushy. Then after tempering, I add a lot of water and again cook on the lowest flame till it gets rich and creamy. That takes another 1.5 to 2 hrs. So, if you want to make it for lunch, I would suggest starting it right after breakfast. \n\nADJUSTMENTS &#8211; YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE\n\n\nTempering: I don&#8217;t add onion in this recipe but if you want, you can add 1 to 2 large onions, pureed well or finely chopped. Cook till they get brown and caramalised. \nButter: I use store bought milk cream in this recipe but you can substitute that with butter or homemade milk cream which we call malai in hindi. If using malai, blend it first otherwise you will see tiny white pieces all over. \n\n\n\n\nCAN WE MAKE IT VEGAN?\n\nOf course. Why not? I am going to try and share the vegan dal makhani too very soon. And you can trust me, it would be as delicious as this one. We ordered vegan dal makhani once and it was so delicious. I mean it was hard to tell whether it was vegan or not. That gave me the motivation to try it at home too. So, very soon you will have one healthy dal makhani recipe with no compromise on the taste. \n\nHOW TO SERVE?\n\nTo have the best experience, serve it hot. It tastes best with any kind of Indian bread &#8211; chapati, paratha, naan, tandoori roti, missi roti. We also love it with aalu paratha. You can try that. It tastes delicious. \n\nWe also serve it with some jeera rice or simple steamed rice. For the salad, we like it with some pickled onion. Or if you don&#8217;t have that, serve it with some onion and sliced cucumber.\n\nNow grab all the ingredients because you are ready to make Dhaba-style dal makhani at home. Enjoy it over lunch or some weekend brunch. Make it for your friends over any house party or cook it for any celebration at home. It will be a show-stopper. Don&#8217;t believe me, TRY IT.\n\nIf you like the recipe, please share the photo on Instagram and tag us too @marriedfriends.

Both are slow-cooked. The only main difference is the dal used to make these recipes. Dal Bukhara is made only with urad dal (whole) while dal makhani is made of urad dal (whole) and rajma (kidney beans). Both if these deals taste very delicious.\nIs dal makhani fattening?I would say that anything can make you fat if you eat an excess of it. Eat moderately and have a balanced life. Although dal makhani is made of butter and fresh cream, it is eaten rarely on some special occasion or once in a while. So, do not worry about calories. Enjoy your happy meal. Moreover, it is such a delicious recipe that it would be bad to keep yourself away from it.\nCan we eat dal makhani at night?It is a little heavy for the stomach. If you plan to have it over dinner, keep a gap of at least 2 &#8211; 3 hrs between your meal and bedtime. It takes some time to get digested.\nWhat is best to eat with dal makhani?Dal Makhani goes very well roti/chapati, paratha, naan, tandoori roti, or any other Indian bread too. It tastes so good with aalu paratha as well. You must try that. You can also serve it with jeera rice or plain steamed rice. For salads, serve it with some pickled onion.\nCan we make vegan dal makhani?Yes. Totally. Replace milk cream or butter with cashew cream or coconut milk. It tastes equally good. It is difficult to tell if it is vegan or not. These days, we even have options for plant-based butter. You can try that too but make sure to buy a good brand with fewer ingredients and additives.\n\n","instructions":"Wash urad dal and rajma with water 2 to 3 times.

With this recipe, you can&#8217;t even notice that it is made of leftovers. It has a creamy filling, crunchy salad, and refreshing sauces. Perfect for lunch or dinner.</p>\n<p>Must-Try.</p>\n","content":"Making Dhaba Style Dal Makhani tested your patience? Don&#8217;t worry. Always make it a little extra so that the next day you can just relax and make these easy-peasy wraps using the leftover dal makhani. \nYou can call it a roll, a wrap, or a Frankie – Your choice. But you have to try this delicious, flavourful, and very different wrap recipe. I can guarantee you that after having this, you will stop buying wraps from restaurants. It is creamy, crunchy, a little sweet, a little sour, and a lot tasty. Perfect for a quick lunch or dinner and even for a delightful weekend brunch.\nSTORY TIME\nLet me share how we discovered this wrap.\nDo you know Faasos – an Indian online food service? One day, we decided to order food online. We started looking at the menu of Faasos. They had very exciting veg wraps on their menu. I only remember Dal Makhani though because that is what we ordered and it was extremely delicious. I don’t know if they still have those wraps.\nDuring the COVID lockdown time, we started craving those wraps. But since we were not ordering anything at that time, we had one option left – make it at home. Not only we tried dal makhani wrap at home but also made some wraps with leftover rajma (kidney bean curry) &amp; chhole (chickpea curry). All three wraps were extremely delicious. Since then, whenever we make these curries at home, we always make some extra so that we can have these wraps the next day.\nOne more thing which we tried in this recipe is hung curd. It is such a good replacement for sour cream. It tastes exactly the same. So you don’t need any sour cream. Just hang some yogurt in a cloth for a few hours and you are good to go.\nIf you don’t have time, watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPONENTS OF VEG DAL MAKHANI WRAP\nYou can be as creative as you want. You can make your own adjustments to this recipe. This recipe is quite forgiving. You don’t need to stick to the exact recipe. Just follow your heart 🙂\nBut below are the preparation you need to do for this recipe:\n\nDal Makhani: I already have the recipe of dhaba style dal makhani. You must try that. Dal makhani gets thicker by the next day. That is just perfect for the wraps. Do not add any water in it. While making the filling, it will get heated and will become creamy and less thicker again. \nBaked Potatoes: We tried it randomly one day with one of our wraps and it just changed the game of that recipe altogether. It tasted so good that since then we add baked potatoes in every wrap we make. I added baked potatoes in rajma wrap but not in this recipe. I just wanted to share one more option with no baked potatoes but if you want you can try with baked potatoes too.\nFresh Salad: Salad adds a nice crunch and freshness to the wraps. You can add any salad vegetable you like – onion, tomato, avocado, celery, bell peppers, radish, greens, purple cabbage, cucumber. Avocados add a nice creaminess to the wraps. If you want to avoid any mayo or any dairy, just add some ripe avocados instead. \nHung Curd Dip: We don’t like to use mayonnaise or any other spread for these wraps. Hung curd goes very well with most wraps. Just hang some yogurt/curd in a cloth or a regular sieve which we use to strain the tea. Leave it like that for 1 hour so that it becomes all thick and creamy. If you don’t have time, just hang it when you start your preparation.\n\n\nADJUSTMENTS – YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE\n\nTortilla: You can make this wrap using a store-bought tortilla or you can make tortillas at home too. You can even use whole wheat chapati/roti or paratha. Just make sure to make it slightly bigger in size so that it will be easier to roll it well.\nSauce: I like the sauce which is slightly sweeter in taste. But you can use any sauce or even tomato ketchup in this recipe. If you don’t want, you can skip it too.\nHung Curd: I use hung curd because it is easily available and always in my home. But you can even use sour cream in place of the hung curd.\n\nHOW TO STORE IT?\nI always make it fresh but if you want to make a big batch and store it, you can do that too. Just make the wraps, put them in an air-tight container, and store them in your freezer for a few weeks. When you want to eat it, just heat them well and enjoy.\n\nNow grab all the ingredients and let’s make some exciting dal makhani wraps from the leftover&nbsp;Dhaba style dal makhani. If you have kids, imagine how many veggies you can make them eat in one serving. Right?\nI hope you will love this vegetarian, simple, delicious wrap recipe.

This recipe is a delicious way to include millets in your regular diet. This ragi or finger millet dosa is just perfect for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. </p>\n<p>Ready for a FOOLPROOF recipe?</p>\n","content":"Making a crispy, restaurant like dosa was a fantasy earlier. But with this recipe, trust me, you can make a gorgeous, crispy dosa at home too. It is a foolproof recipe for someone like me &#8211; who tried making dosa so many times and always failed and eventually gave up. But now I can make dosa even with my eyes closed. Okay, that&#8217;s an exaggeration but you got my point. Right?\nI already shared Instant Sooji Dosa Recipe. It is no less than authentic South Indian Dosa which is made by fermenting the batter made of different dals. And this time I made the regular dosa even more healthy by including ragi or finger millet flour in it. Millets are so healthy that you must make them a part of your kitchen, your diet. \nInstant &amp; Crispy Sooji Dosa\nTIPS TO MAKE IT RIGHT\n\nGrind Sooji: Earlier I tried to make dosa using sooji rava because that&#8217;s how I used to make uttapam and Gordon Ramsay&#8217;s Potato Pancake. Sooji does get soft when you make the batter and let it rest for a while. But it doesn&#8217;t give the right texture and crispiness needed for a dosa. Grinding sooji into a fine powder is important. \nPoha or Rice Flour: I also grind some poha/rice flakes along with the sooji. You can also use rice flour instead. This ingredient gives nice crispiness to the dosa.\nWhole Wheat Flour: The dosa batter needs a good binding agent that can make it spread well on the pan. Whole wheat flour helps in doing that. \nSugar: Don&#8217;t worry. Sugar won&#8217;t make the dosa sweet. It helps in giving a nice restaurant-style browning to the dosa. It also enhances the flavor of the dosa. \nBatter Consistency: More than the right kind of pan, you need to have the right consistency of the batter. It is THE MOST IMPORTANT thing. It should neither be thick nor thin otherwise it will be difficult to spread it on the pan. You need a medium consistency batter. Just follow the recipe and you will get that.\nHeat: Heat on the pan also plays a major role in making a perfect dosa. If the pan is too hot, you won&#8217;t be able to spread the batter. It will start sticking to the pan and will form lumps. That&#8217;s why keep the flame on medium, sprinkle water at the start, and before making each dosa. This reduces the temperature of the pan. Wipe off the water and then pour the batter and spread it in circular motion. You will get good results. \nOil: I always used to think that oiling the pan is important because that will prevent sticking the batter to the pan. NEVER EVER DO IT. Learn from my mistakes. The oil prevents the easy spreading of the batter. \n\nIf you don&#8217;t have time, watch the video instead. And if you enjoyed the video, Please Subscribe to our youtube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nCAN I ONLY MAKE IT WITH RAGI FLOUR?\nRagi or finger millet flour makes soft dosa. To add crispiness to it, you need to add sooji and rice flour to the batter. Also, ragi is gluten-free. So, we need some flour to bind the batter well. It would be easier to spread also. For that, we add a little bit of whole wheat flour to the batter. \nBut, if you want some gluten-free options, just try it with ragi flour only. You can mix some urad dal flour with it and you will get a delicious dosa. \nWHAT CAN RUIN THE DOSA?\nTwo things that can really ruin your dosa-making experience are Curd and Baking Soda. \nIf your curd is sitting in the fridge for a long time, chances are that your dosa will become soggy. It happens. It is tough to explain the texture but it just ruins the mood.\nAlso, if the baking soda has expired, you won&#8217;t get a light, airy batter. The texture of the dosa also changes because of that. But you can check the quality of baking soda. Just add a little bit of lemon juice to it. If it forms bubbles, it means your baking soda is just perfect. If not, it is time to buy a new pack.\n\nWHAT GOES WELL WITH DOSA?\nHonestly, sometimes I don&#8217;t need anything with dosa. Just some paper-thin dosa and a cup of coffee (vegan). I am sorted. But if you want to enjoy it fully, serve it with the following:\n\nSambar (in the video)\nOnion-Tomato Chutney (in the video)\nCoconut Chutney (in the video)\nCoconut Coriander Chutney (","instructions":"In a mixer grinder, add sooji and poha/rice flakes.

Keep whisking.\nAdd more water and whisk till you get a lump-free, medium consistency batter.\nLet it rest for 10-15 minutes.

And he doesn&#8217;t want to eat that anywhere else except for Delhi. When we were in Pune, Maharashtra, he missed that so much.

Earlier, I used to think that to get that dark color, we need to make it in a cast-iron kadhai or pan. The cast-iron pan/kadhai makes the food slightly darker in color. But, what if we don&#8217;t have it? Can&#8217;t we make dark-colored chole without it?\nYes. You Can.\nYou just need to have the right balance of certain ingredients and know the right technique to make it. Read along to know what I am talking about.\n1 &#8211; INGREDIENTS\nI practiced a lot to find the right balance of spices. I made it using the store-bought chana masala too. But honestly, it doesn&#8217;t give that same taste. Then I tried to make the chana masala at home and freshly made spice mix is actually a game-changer in this recipe. \nTo get that dark color, you need to have these 4 ingredients &#8211; tea leaf, anardana powder, coriander powder, and imli paste. These ingredients not just add a nice dark color but also give a delicious taste to the curry. You can not skip any of these ingredients. Instead of anardana powder, you can add dried amla too. \n2 &#8211; TECHNIQUE\nJust adding the ingredients is not enough. Knowing the right technique to make it is also very important. It is important for the nice color and for the perfect texture of the curry. \nTo make Pindi Chole, DO NOT add chole (or chickpeas) along with the water in which it was cooked. Rather, strain the cooked chickpeas and add them to the tempering along with the prepared chana masala. Then cook it for a couple of minutes on medium-high flame. This will roast the cooked chickpeas and the added spice mix too, resulting in a much darker color. \nThen keep adding the water in which chickpeas were cooked. DO NOT add the entire water at once. Add just 1 ladle at a time and cook till the water is all absorbed/evaporated. After a while, the chickpeas will become mushy and soft and you will start getting a nice thick gravy. \nThat&#8217;s it. Just follow these two steps and you will be able to make a restaurant-style Pindi Chole at home. It&#8217;s Easy. Right?\nIf you are a fan of Indian curries, you must try these recipes too &#8211; Punjabi Rajma Masala, Dhaba Style Dal Makhani.\nHOW TO COOK CHICKPEAS/CHOLE?\nBefore cooking chickpeas, always soak them in water overnight or at least for 6 to 8 hours. This step is very important because it helps in the faster cooking of chickpeas. After they are soaked for hours, chickpeas absorb the water and become bigger in size. That is why always soak them in a bigger bowl with a water level at least 3 inches above the level of chickpeas.\nTo cook chickpeas, you will need either a pressure cooker or an Instant Pot. \nPressure Cooker: \nAdd chickpeas to the pressure cooker with enough water. Add some salt (and other spices as suggested in the recipe) and close the lid. Let them cook on high flame till the first whistle. After a whistle, lower the flame and cook for another 20 minutes. Let it depressurize on its own. Once depressurized, you will notice that the chickpeas are soft and tender. \nInstant Pot:\nThis is one easy method to cook anything. You just need to add chickpeas, water, some salt, and other seasonings. Close the lid and choose the BEAN CHILI mode. It cooks in 30 minutes. Then, let it release the pressure on its own.\nI would suggest not to use any pot or pan to cook chickpeas. They take a very long time to get soft and well cooked. \nIS IT VEGAN?\nYes. It is vegan. \nGenerally, it is made with ghee or clarified butter but I made this recipe with cooking oil. Trust me. You won&#8217;t notice any difference in the taste. Rest all the ingredients used in the recipe are plant-based. \nMore Vegan recipes to try &#8211; Non-Fried Vada Pav, Banana Walnut Muffins, Mini Mango Cheesecake, Gobhi Manchurian.\nHOW TO SERVE PINDI CHOLE?\nThe perfect partner of Pindi chole is soft and fluffy bhature. But you can also serve it with poori or paratha. One thing which enhances the taste, even more, is some fried, crispy, and seasoned potatoes. It tastes very good with Pindi Chole. \nAlso, serve it with some tangy coriander chutney and chopped onion on the side. If you like, add some salt and lemon juice to the onions. \nThat&#8217;s it, my dear friend. You are all ready to make Dilli wale Pindi Chole at home.

You will end up with a fulfilled heart and a big smile. </p>\n","content":"\nSomeone, please clarify. Is it Green Thai Curry or Thai Green Curry?\n\nWhatever it is, it is just so delicious. It is light, spicy, flavorful, and healthy too. Perfect for lunch or dinner or even for a weekend brunch when you want something quick and something very tasty. Also, I have a perfect way to keep the green Thai curry &#8220;Green&#8221; and gorgeous. How do I do that? Read along my friend.\n\nSTORY TIME\n\nThe first time we had Thai green curry was in a fancy Thai Restaurant in Pune, Maharashtra. We were very excited and ordered both the curries &#8211; red and green. And guess what, we didn&#8217;t like any. Yes. It was kind of sweet and that coconutty flavor did not suit our taste buds. \n\nI never thought of making it at home since we just didn&#8217;t like it at all. But one day, someone asked me to share the recipe of Thai Green Curry. I couldn&#8217;t say no. I had to try it myself and create a recipe that we both can enjoy. And guess what, we did it. This homemade Thai green curry was so delicious and the fragrance is something to die for. I am not exaggerating. The aroma of fresh basil and other herbs and spices is beyond any explanation. \n\nAnd I would say, that if you are someone like us, who don&#8217;t like Thai Green Curry or who don&#8217;t like any curry made of coconut, just try this one. You will love it. \n\nIf you don&#8217;t have time, watch the video instead. If you enjoyed the video, Please Subscribe 🙂\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESSENTIALS FOR THAI GREEN CURRY\n\n1 &#8211; THAI GREEN CURRY PASTE\n\nYou can easily use store-bought Thai green curry paste but the aroma &amp; the flavor that freshly made paste gives are unmatched. I tried both and telling you from my experience. And don&#8217;t worry. Making the paste at home is quite easy. Just dump all the ingredients in a mixer-grinder, grind and it&#8217;s done. Also, if possible, make it with fresh Thai basil leaves. It tastes much better. I have a basil plant at home and whenever I pluck some leaves for my recipes, my heart breaks into 1000 pieces. But the aroma that it releases makes everything better 🙂\n\n2 &#8211; VEGETABLE BROTH\n\nSome people use water instead of broth but let me tell you that the vegetable broth is like pure gold. It takes the taste to the next level. I make vegetable broth at home using all the vegetable discards and leftover raw vegetables. They contain a lot of nutrients. So, why to waste?\n\nI have a youtube video of vegetable broth. You can check that if you like. Click here. \n\nYou can even use vegetable broth to make Veg Khow Suey.\n\nVeg Khow Suey\n\n3 &#8211; COCONUT MILK\n\nThis is one of the most important ingredients of this recipe. If you are unsure about the flavor of coconut milk in curries, you can make it with the more diluted coconut milk. I made this recipe using coconut milk with around 86% coconut extract. It was quite thick and flavorful. \n\nYou can also reduce the amount of coconut milk and increase the amount of vegetable broth in the curry. So, there is no rule. Modify according to your taste. But let me share that this curry has so many different herbs and spices that the flavor of coconut milk doesn&#8217;t dominate at all. \n\n4 &#8211; VEGETABLES\n\nWhat I love about this recipe is that you can any veggie of your choice. Since I am a veggie-lover, I add all kinds of veggies to it &#8211; mushrooms, beans, carrots, broccoli, zucchini, spring onions, bell peppers. Also, tofu. That is my favorite. So, just make it as colorful as you like. \n\nTo make the curry green and gorgeous, I even add a little bit of spinach puree to it. Just blend some raw spinach leaves with some water and add that in the end. That&#8217;s it. \n\n5 &#8211; HERBS &amp; SPICES\n\nTwo ingredients are very important for this recipe &#8211; lemongrass and kaffir lime.\n\nThey both add a very nice flavor and aroma to the curry but kaffir lime is something that is not very easily available. I couldn&#8217;t find kaffir lime while making this recipe. So, I substituted that with some lemon zest and lemon juice. Trust me. It tastes amazing. \n\n\n\nHOW TO SERVE THAI GREEN CURRY?\n\nTraditionally, it is served with Jasmine rice or rice noodles. But you can serve it with any kind of rice you have. we mostly enjoy it with rice instead of noodles. I always season the rice with some ginger, bay leaves, and salt. It becomes aromatic and gives a nice flavor overall.  \n\nThat’s it, my dear friend. You are all ready to make veg or vegan Thai green curry. It is perfect for lunch, dinner, or makes a delicious brunch over the weekend.

It sounds ironic because makkhan (butter) is in its name. Making it without it is like going against the law. Right 😀\nBut hey, butter or milk cream is added to make it rich and creamy and you can actually get that same texture and creaminess with some vegan substitutes. Don&#8217;t believe me. Try it out and thank me later. \nI also have a recipe for dhaba style dal makhani too. You can make both and compare. In my opinion, it is hard to tell any difference. By the way, if you make any of these dal makhani recipes, make it a little extra so that with the leftover you can try our delicious dal makhani wraps. \nDal Makhani Wraps\nSTORY TIME\nIf you know me and follow my recipes, you know how I always try to make the recipes healthier with no compromise on the taste. For example, I made healthier strawberry cheesecake. Vegan mango cheesecake is something extremely delicious, light, and healthy too. How can I forget Non-Fried Vada Pav? So, now you know my passion and love to make healthier recipes for you all. \nBut a few years ago, someone asked me to make a healthier version of dal makhani. I laughed and thought that it is not possible. But I was wrong. I did it. I realized that the creaminess of dal makhani is not dependent on any butter or milk cream. The key is SLOW COOKING. Urad dal gets nice and smooth and creamy if you cook it for a long time. And to make it more creamy and rich, you can simply add cashew paste and coconut cream. Don&#8217;t worry, you won&#8217;t get coconut flavor dal makhani. It doesn&#8217;t dominate with all other ingredients added to the recipe. \nIf you are in hurry, watch the video instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nSECRET OF DAL MAKHANI\nYou may think that the creaminess of dal makhani comes from adding a lot of cream or butter to it. That is not true. I mean, you need that but that is not the only thing to get that rich and creamy texture. The secret is – SLOW COOKING. That’s right my friend. There is no shortcut to that. You have to have patience, a lot of it while making this delicious recipe.\nHow Slow Cooking helps?\nWell, the dal which we use in this recipe – urad dal (whole) or urad chilka – gets very starchy and creamy when you cook it for a very long time. The more you cook, the more creamy it gets. In many restaurants or dhabas, by the end of the day, when they are done with making naan or roti on the tandoor, they put this dal on it and leave it to cook overnight. Dal cooks slowly on hot coal for the entire night and that is how you get that rich and creamy texture in it.\nBut obviously, you can’t do that at home. Although, my Instant Pot has an option of slow cooking which I will try one day. I slow cook this dal in two parts. First, when I pressure cook urad dal and rajma together. After a whistle in the pressure cooker, I cook it on the lowest flame for another 40 to 50 minutes till it gets well cooked and mushy. Then after tempering, I add a lot of water and again cook on the lowest flame till it gets rich and creamy. That takes another 1.5 to 2 hrs. So, if you want to make it for lunch, I would suggest starting it right after breakfast. &amp; have Patience 🙂\nDhaba Style Dal Makhani\nADJUSTMENTS – YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE\n\nTempering: I added onion paste in this recipe but you can totally avoid that. I made it without onion in dhaba style dal makhani and it tastes amazing. So, you have two options. Make it either way.\nCream: I made vegan dal makhani using cashew paste and coconut cream or coconut milk. But you can make it only with cashew paste or almond paste. Just increase the quantity if you don&#8217;t want to use the coconut cream. Nut cream make it thick and creamy and gives the exact same texture as regular non-vegan dal makhani.\n\nCOCONUT CREAM &#8211; WHAT&#8217;S THAT?\nWhenever I use coconut cream in my recipes, I get questions about it. People say that they couldn&#8217;t find coconut cream or from where they can buy it. Well, it is very simple to make. Just put your can of coconut milk in the coolest part of your refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Open the can and Voila! You will get a thick cream on the top. Just take that out. That&#8217;s your coconut cream. Easy. Right?\nHOW TO SERVE?\nTo have the best experience, serve it hot. It tastes best with any kind of Indian bread – chapati, paratha, naan, tandoori roti, Missi roti. We also love it with aalu paratha. You can try that. It tastes delicious.\nWe also serve it with some jeera rice or simple steamed rice. For the salad, we like it with some pickled onion. Or if you don’t have that, serve it with some onion and sliced cucumber.\nDal Makhani &#8211; Ready to Eat\nNow grab all the ingredients because you are ready to make Dhaba-style dal makhani but vegan. Enjoy it over lunch or some weekend brunch. Make it for your friends over any house party or cook it for any celebration at home. It will be a show-stopper.

Both are slow-cooked. The only main difference is the dal used to make these recipes. Dal Bukhara is made only with urad dal (whole) while dal makhani is made of urad dal (whole) and rajma (kidney beans). Both if these deals taste very delicious.\nIs dal makhani fattening?I would say that anything can make you fat if you eat an excess of it. Eat moderately and have a balanced life. Although dal makhani is made of butter and fresh cream, it is eaten rarely on some special occasion or once in a while. So, do not worry about calories. Enjoy your happy meal. Moreover, it is such a delicious recipe that it would be bad to keep yourself away from it.\nCan we eat dal makhani at night?It is a little heavy for the stomach. If you plan to have it over dinner, keep a gap of at least 2 &#8211; 3 hrs between your meal and bedtime. It takes some time to get digested.\nWhat is best to eat with dal makhani?Dal Makhani goes very well roti/chapati, paratha, naan, tandoori roti, or any other Indian bread too. It tastes so good with aalu paratha as well. You must try that. You can also serve it with jeera rice or plain steamed rice. For salads, serve it with some pickled onion.\nCan we make vegan dal makhani?Yes. Totally. Replace milk cream or butter with cashew cream or coconut milk. It tastes equally good. It is difficult to tell if it is vegan or not. These days, we even have options for plant-based butter. You can try that too but make sure to buy a good brand with fewer ingredients and additives.\n\n","instructions":"Wash urad dal and rajma with water 2 to 3 times.

After having it, you will end up with a fulfilled stomach and a big smile on your face. Guaranteed!\nSTORY TIME\nLet me confess something first. I am not a fan of paneer. I only like Matar Paneer and that&#8217;s it. Please don&#8217;t hate me because my husband compensates for this with his overlove for paneer. He can have paneer all day, every day. Literally. But since I am the home chef, I don&#8217;t make different recipes of panner at home.\nOnce he ordered Paneer Tikka Masala from a restaurant. He was very excited to have it. The order arrived and with a big smile on his face, he served himself. His happiness &amp; excitement were totally gone when he saw just 4 pieces of paneer in the Dabba. Thankfully, I ordered something else for myself so he didn&#8217;t need to share those 4 pieces. But I felt bad for him. I have a good heart you know 😀\nThen I decided to make this recipe for him. Happiness and excitement are back again in his life.\nIf you don&#8217;t have time, watch the video instead. If you enjoy the video, Please Subscribe to the youtube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEPS TO MAKE THE RECIPE\n1 &#8211; MARINATION\nDelicious marination is the soul of this recipe. But just seasoning panner and other veggies with different spices and curd is not enough. You need to coat them and let them rest to develop more flavors. The acidic ingredient (curd or yogurt) is very important in marination because it makes the way for all the flavors to seep into the veggies and paneer. You need patience. But we will do anything for a tempting meal. Right?\n2 &#8211; DRY ROASTING\nThere are many ways to cook or dry roast the marinated pieces. Traditionally, it is done in a clay oven or tandoor. You get a nice earthy flavor in that. But who has that in our modern homes? I don&#8217;t. But I have my favorite grill sandwich maker which opens to 180 degrees and is perfect to make paneer tikkas. I put the marinated pieces on a skewer and roast them on it. It doesn&#8217;t stick and comes out well roasted. \nYou can even do the same thing on a pan. Just place all the marinated pieces on a greased pan or tawa and roast them from all sides. It is very easy. You can even put all pieces on a skewer and directly cook them on the gas flame. It gives a nice charred flavor too. But just be careful with this. Cover the area around the gas burner with a foil because when you roast, the juice of the veggies and marination drips and it may ruin your gas stove. Covering also means less cleaning which we all need in our life. \n3 &#8211; GRAVY\nThe gravy of paneer tikka masala is made of onion tomato. It is creamy and spicy too. But you can make the gravy as you like it. In this recipe, I added curd for creaminess and a hint of tanginess. I balanced that with a pinch of sugar. It tastes delicious. You can even make the gravy with cashew paste or milk cream. You can make it without onion. Gravy with just the tomatoes also tastes good. \nOne important flavor enhancer of the gravy is Kasuri methi. It is literally a game-changer in any kind of gravy. I even add it in dal makhani, and Pindi chole. You must try these recipes too. \nCAN WE MAKE IT VEGAN?\nYes. Of course. \nIn the same recipe, just replace the paneer with firm tofu. Instead of dairy curd, you can use vegan curd. \nYou can make a creamy gravy using cashew paste, coconut milk or coconut cream, or any vegan curd too. Don&#8217;t be afraid to experiment. \nIf you want more vegan recipe suggestions, try our Thai green curry, vegan banana walnut muffins, mini mango cheesecake. \nVegan Thai Green Curry\nVegan Mango Cheesecake\nHOW TO SERVE?\nTo have the best experience, serve it hot. It tastes best with any kind of Indian bread – chapati, paratha, naan, or tandoori roti. We also serve it with some jeera rice or simple steamed rice. For the salad, we like it with some pickled onion. Or if you don’t have that, just serve it with some thinly sliced onions. \nI always make it a little extra because the next day it gets more delicious. Overnight, all the flavors marry and mingle with each other and make the gravy even more flavorful.

It is not just popular in India but loved all across the world. Surprised? I am not. </p>\n<p>It is one the most comforting recipes. You want something quick and delicious, just make Aloo Paratha &#038; chai. </p>\n","content":"I have never met anyone who doesn&#8217;t love aalu paratha (stuffed potato Indian flatbread). And in my opinion, aalu paratha is the king of all the stuffed parathas. What do you think? \nThe best thing about it is that you can make it any which way. If you are in a hurry, just mash some boiled potatoes, season it with some salt, stuff, roll, and cook. I have a different style of making the stuffing. I season it with some different aromatic spices, add some chopped onions for a slight crunch. The best of all is some roasted peas. It adds a nice color and bite to these parathas. Ahhhhh. I am drooling while writing. You must try my version of aalu paratha. BEWARE. No one can eat just one 😀\nSTORY TIME\nThere was a time when making stuffed aalu paratha was a big challenge in my life. I tried it so many times but always failed miserably. Some people are pro in it but I am not one of them. I even quit trying once and whenever we craved some delicious parathas, we either used to go to our friend&#8217;s place or go to any restaurant. But I was not happy and satisfied with that. You see, I married a Punjabi man. He grew up eating stuffed parathas every day. It is his first love.  I had to learn it.\nI unlearned everything and started learning again. In the process, I created my own tips and tricks to master this recipe. And now it is unbelievable for me but I can teach foreigners the art of making a perfectly round aloo paratha in just 1 hour. Yes. I take classes where I teach this recipe to people from all over the world and I get excited when I see their round aloo parathas. Goosebumps Alert. If you also want to learn from me personally, you can register for my Airbnb Experiences classes.\n&amp; not to forget, Jatin (my husband) is also very happy now because now he can get his favorite aalu paratha whenever he wants. \nAloo Paratha made by a student\nTIPS TO MAKE IT RIGHT\nStuffed parathas have just two elements &#8211; dough and stuffing. There are certain things that you need to keep in mind while working on them. \n1 &#8211; DOUGH\nStuffed parathas need a soft dough. If it is hard, the stuffing will start to come out while rolling. If it is too soft, it doesn&#8217;t do any harm, but the dough becomes a little difficult to manage. Are you wondering what is soft dough? Hmmmm&#8230;This is something you learn with practice. You need to feel the dough to understand it. But if you are a beginner, don&#8217;t worry. Just press it with your fingers, and if it doesn&#8217;t resist, it is just perfect. \nKneading the dough\nOne thing you need to remember is that every ingredient is different. Every flour is different. Every flour has a different water absorption capacity. So, don&#8217;t follow the recipe blindly. Recipes are just a guide. You may need to adjust the quantity of water, as needed. Just remember, we need a Soft Dough. \nA Soft Dough for Parathas\n2 &#8211; STUFFING\nAs I said, every ingredient is different. This goes for potatoes as well. Some potatoes are too starchy and become soggy when you make the stuffing. We need the potatoes that are a little dry. Now how to find this? Well, it is difficult since in most places even the vendors don&#8217;t know much about the varieties of potatoes they are selling. But, old potatoes (purana aalu) are better. \nHonestly, you don&#8217;t need to worry much about potatoes and flour. You will get it once you start making parathas.  I am telling you just to make you mentally prepared for this. \nStuffing\nHOW TO BOIL POTATOES?\n\nPressure Cooker &#8211; Wash the potatoes well. I prefer to cut them in half because that makes the process faster. Place them in the pressure cooker. Add water till the potatoes are well covered. Close the lid and let them cook on high flame till the first whistle. After one whistle, lower the flame and let it cook for another 5 to 7 minutes. Switch off the flame and let it depressurize on its own. After that, just strain the water and let it cool down completely. \nMicrowave &#8211; I never tried it but I heard that cooking potatoes in microwave is quite easy. Just place the potatoes in a microwave safe plate and microwave for 5 to 7 minutes. Insert a knife at the center. If it goes through, it means it is well cooked. If not, let it cook for one minute and check. Every microwave is different. Hence, your time of cooking may vary. \nInstant Pot &#8211; Add the potatoes in the Instant Pot vessel. Add enough water to cover. Set the Pressure Cook mode for 5 to 6 minutes. Drain the water and let them cool completely. \nPan &#8211; This is a little time consuming method but totally doable. Cut potatoes in half and place them in a pan. Add enough water to cover them completely. It needs extra water since a lot of water evaporartes while cooking. Cook on medium flame till they are fork-tender. Drain and let them cool completely. \n\nStuffed Aloo Paratha\nIS THIS VEGAN?\nGenerally, Aloo Parathas are cooked in ghee but that is totally optional. I always cook my parathas in cooking oil. &amp; that makes this recipe 100 percent vegan.\nHOW TO SERVE?\nThere are many ways you can enjoy it.\n\nHot Tea/Chai\nIndian Pickles\nButter (homemade preferably)\nCurd/Yogurt seasoned with salt, roasted cumin and boondi\n\nApart from this, we also love aalu parathas with Punjabi Rajma Masala (Kidney Bean Curry) and Dhaba Style Dal makhani. \nNow grab all the ingredients because you are ready to make this recipe.

Oh, my mouth is watering. \nWHAT IS GHEVAR?\nFor me, it is the king of all Indian sweets. It is a Rajasthani sweet traditionally associated with the Teej festival. It is available only during the rainy season for a month or two and then we have to wait for another year to enjoy this sweet treat. Although, now in some parts of India you can get it throughout the year.\nIt is a disc-shaped sweet and crispy cake, made of maida (refined flour), soaked in sugar syrup, and topped with some nuts. Making it is an art. A streak of thin batter goes into the hot ghee or oil and then it forms volcano-like bubbles which settle in a few seconds. Then again you release a streak of batter in the oil. It is repeated several times and then you get a honeycomb-like disc-shaped structure. Watching the making process is actually a treat to the eyes. \nWHY IS IT SEASONAL?\nWhen deep-fried, it comes out all crispy and it needs some moisture to become slightly soft. That is why it is made in the rainy season. In the rainy season, there is humidity. It absorbs the moisture in the air and becomes soft and tender. But now, the demand for crispy Ghevar is increasing. That&#8217;s why in some parts, you get it throughout the year.\nIf you don&#8217;t have much time, watch the video instead. If you enjoy the video, Please Subscribe to our youtube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY TIME\nEverybody says that it is very difficult to make and you just can not make it right at home. Since I always heard that I never even thought of trying it out at home. Also, it is deep-fried and I just don&#8217;t like to do that. We always bought it from the sweet shops. It is our favorite. We buy a pack of 1 Kg and it gets finished in a day. Then we buy again and this repeats till the season lasts. But then COVID happened. And we stopped buying food from outside. \nJatin loved it so much and when he started craving it, he decided to make it at home. Oh boy. He has guts. He watched so many recipes and one day he bought all the ingredients. With full excitement, he started the cooking process. He was even saying that he will make a big batch and send it to our families. But he failed miserably. Oh boy. His disappointment made me sad. \nThen after a year, when again the Ghevar season came, I decided to give this bad boy a try. With full excitement, I was telling everyone that I am going to make it and everyone said that it is difficult and can&#8217;t be made at home. So, I didn&#8217;t keep high hopes. I wanted to try and see what the fuss is all about. And I wanted to surprise Jatin and make him happy. To my surprise, I did it. My first attempt was okay and my second attempt, well Jatin said that it is exactly like what we get in sweet shops. Yay. Victory.\n&amp; then I realized that MAKING GHEVAR IS EASY!\nMy Second Attempt of Ghevar\nELEMENTS OF GHEVAR\nMaking Ghevar is easy. But it is a time-consuming recipe. You need to prepare the following things for that:\n1 &#8211; SUGAR SYRUP\nFor Ghevar, you need 1-Thread sugar syrup. It is called Ek-taar ki chashni in Hindi. It is very simple to make and needs just four ingredients &#8211; sugar, water, cardamom, and lemon juice. Why lemon juice? Well, it prevents the crystalization of sugar syrup. Do not worry, it doesn&#8217;t make it lemony. \nTo test if it is perfect, take out a drop of sugar syrup in a bowl, let it cool down. Then press it in between your index finger and thumb, release the pressure slightly and you will see one thread of sugar syrup. But it gets difficult to find out if you are a beginner. So, once the sugar dissolves, lower the flame and let it cook for 7 to 10 minutes. It will be just perfect. \n2 &#8211; RABDI\nYou can make it either with whole milk only or you can mix whole milk and milk powder. Both of them tastes very good. The only difference is TIME. Milk rabdi takes a very long time to get done and you need to keep stirring in between otherwise it sticks to the bottom and may burn. If you have patience, go for it. But if you want to speed up the process and make a quick version of rabdi, just mix it up with milk powder. It tastes equally good and takes just 30 to 45 minutes to cook. One more best thing about it is that it doesn&#8217;t make any malai on top or on the sides and you get a creamy and smooth rabdi. That is what I prefer on my ghewar. \nTo make rabdi. make sure you use a heavy bottom pan. Otherwise, milk sticks to the bottom and starts burning. If it sticks to the bottom and you get clumps in your rabdi, just strain it using a sieve. Do not worry. It will be all nice and smooth. \n3 &#8211; BATTER\nThis is the most important element of making ghewar. But it is easy. We are not going to make it the traditional way, with our hands. I am going to use an easy process for the same. I made the batter using my mixer grinder. Trust me. It doesn&#8217;t make any difference. Plus, it saves a lot of time. Also, I do not add gram flour or besan to the batter. It makes the ghewar extremely crispy. It literally hurt my jaws. \nOne MOST IMPORTANT thing which you can&#8217;t ignore is that you need a cold batter for this recipe. When you drip the cold batter in hot oil or ghee, it releases the moisture and in the process, creates a honeycomb-like structure. I take the batter in a pourer and put the rest of it in the refrigerator. \nIf while churning, the batter forms a creamy and frothy layer on top, do not worry. Just strain it using a sieve. It will be all okay. \n\nTIPS TO MAKE IT RIGHT\n1 &#8211; COLD BATTER\nLike I already mentioned above, you can not ignore this step. Use cold water to make the batter and keep it cold at all times.\n2 &#8211; HOT OIL/GHEE\nThe temperature of ghee or oil is also very important. We need it hot. When you pour the cold batter into the ghee/oil, its temperature reduces. That is why it is important to cook it on a high flame at all times. You may reduce it if you think that your ghewar is burning. But increase it again when you see that it is not spluttering enough when you pour the batter.\nNow, if the temperature of oil/ghee is lower, the batter starts collecting at the bottom and forms a clump. You will understand the temperature needed after trying one or two ghevar.\n3 &#8211; POURING\nThis step tests your patience. You can not think about speeding up this step. You won&#8217;t get a good honeycomb-like structure. Always pour a little batter at a time. It splutters and then you have to wait for the bubbles to settle. You need to do this step for a good amount of time. So, make it when you are in a good mood. \n4 &#8211; COOKING PAN\nIf you are a beginner, I would suggest you use a pan or cooker which is deep enough. The reason being, when you pour the batter, it splutters in hot ghee. It may come out if your vessel is not deep enough. Also, whatever vessel you use, just half fill it with ghee or oil.\nPATIENCE IS THE KEY\nI said the same in my Dhaba-style dal makhani, vegan dal makhani, Pindi chhole, mango cheesecake recipes.\nMost of us screw up while making ghewar at home and one of the reasons for that is the lack of patience. It is a time-consuming recipe and we often try to speed up the process. But all good things take time. So, you have to have a lot of patience while making it. You may feel like speeding up the process by pouring a lot of batter, but then you won&#8217;t get good results. Sometimes, we skip chilling the batter and like my husband, use the room temperature water to make ghewar. The result &#8211; FAILED GHEWAR.\nBottom line is &#8211; Have Patience. \nCAN WE STORE IT?\nYes. You can.\nYou can deep fry the ghevar and keep it in the freezer for up to a month. Don&#8217;t put any sugar syrup and rabdi. It reduces the shelf life. \nAfter putting sugar syrup and rabdi, it can stay refrigerated for 2 days. \nNow you are all ready to make ghewar (or ghevar) at home. Just grab all the ingredients and be ready to win the hearts of everyone in your family. You will become a cooking star. Trust me. Trust yourself. Follow the guidelines and you will rock.

That&#8217;s how we make Hara-Bhara kebab (or kabab). This recipe is a sure-shot party hit. The best thing is that it doesn&#8217;t take much time in cooking. It means you can serve them hot to your guests without spending much time in the kitchen. Just prepare everything in advance.\nSTORY TIME\nOnce we invited a lot of guests to our home for dinner. By a lot of guests, I mean a family of 10. There were people of all age groups &#8211; from 5 to 45. We decided to cook everything at home. That was the first time when I was cooking for so many people. I mostly cook for just the two of us. Cooking something that can be enjoyed by everyone was giving me a lot of pressure. But I took a deep breath and made a list of items that need to be prepared. \nFor starters, I made my all-time party hit &#8211; loaded nachos and Hara-Bhara kebab. I made loaded nachos because that is something which can very well be enjoyed by the kids especially. I also made hara bhara kebab because it is not just delicious but cooks quite fast on the pan. No need for deep frying. Just put a big batch on a pan and shallow fry from both sides. I served them with green chutney and some thinly sliced onions. Everyone just went crazy after having it. They still talk about my hara bhara kebab. And one more thing, these tiny babies are quite filling too. That was a surprise. Now I also make it over the weekend. Just some hara bhara kabab and tea. No need to make dinner. \nIf you are wondering about the other items on the menu, I also made &#8211; Paneer Tikka Masala, Dhaba Style Dal Makhani, Jeera Rice, Naan (ordered from the restaurant), and Mini Mango Cheesecake for the dessert.\nIf you are in a hurry, watch the video instead and If you enjoy watching it, Plz Subscribe to our Youtube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nADJUSTMENTS YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE\nVEGETABLES\nThe main ingredient for this recipe is spinach (palak). Apart from that, I add every possible vegetable that is green in color. Yes. You should know that I love green in my food. You can add capsicum, broccoli, zucchini, beans, peas, and coriander. All the vegetables have their unique flavor and when combined they create some kind of magic in the recipe. Plus, even if you don&#8217;t like any of these green veggies, don&#8217;t worry. The mixture gets blended and after that, you won&#8217;t even know what&#8217;s in there. Perfect for your kids too if they are fussy eaters. \nBESAN\nIdeally, this recipe needs besan or gram flour. This helps in binding all the ingredients and shape them into a patty. But when I was filming the recipe, I realized that I don&#8217;t have besan at home. Then, I replaced besan with sattu (flour made of roasted chana). It tasted awesome. Also, I add bread crumbs too in the recipe because I don&#8217;t like the flavor of a lot of besan. That is why I substitute some besan with bread crumbs.\nHOW TO SERVE IT?\nI always serve it with tangy ad minty green chutney which I make with some coriander, mint leaves, and curd. You must try it. Also, serve with some thinly sliced onions on the side. This whole combination makes these kebabs IRRESISTIBLE.\nIS THIS RECIPE VEGAN?\nYes. Of course. The recipe for these kebabs is completely plant-based or vegan. But the chutney which I made had some curd in it. But you can totally substitute the curd in chutney with some vegan curd. \nIf you want more vegan recipe suggestions, try our Thai green curry, vegan banana walnut muffins, vegan dal makhani.\nThai Green Curry (Vegan)\nDal Makhani (Vegan)\nBanana Walnut Muffins (Vegan)\nCAN WE FREEZE IT?\nI guess you can. I never tried freezing them but I freeze potato cheese balls and they last in the freezer for up to a month. So, you shape these kebabs and put them in an air-tight container or zip lock bag. Freeze them in your freezer. \nOtherwise, what I do, I make a big batch of the mixture, use some and then store the rest in the refrigerator. It lasts for 4 to 5 days. And the good thing is that it tastes even better after a couple of days. \nMORE RECIPES FOR THE PARTY:\n\nVeg Lasagna\nGobhi Manchurian\nPindi Chole\n\nNow, grab all the ingredients because you are ready to make the tastiest hara bhara kebab at home.

It tastes good in any form. But my favorite is this Dum Aloo. Baby potatoes covered in rich &#038; creamy gravy &#8211; Yummm. </p>\n<p>It is non-fried but still very tasty. Must Try.</p>\n","content":"Dum aloo is described as soft baby potatoes dipped in rich and creamy onion-tomato gravy. &amp; you don&#8217;t need to deep fry potatoes to get that burst of taste and flavors. Just let the spices, other ingredients, and the cooking process do their magic.\nSTORY TIME\nI love dum aloo. I love anything that is made of potatoes. But I never used to make dum aloo because it required deep frying of potatoes. But whenever I used to see tiny baby potatoes in the market, I used to feel like buying them and make dum aloo at home. Baby potatoes look so cute. Right?\nOne day, I just decided to make dum aloo without deep-frying the potatoes and see how it tastes. I worked on the gravy, made it rich and creamy using cashew cream. I added a hit of tanginess with the curd and to balance that I added a pinch of sugar. And the game-changer is the master of all ingredients &#8211; Kasuri Methi. It makes the gravy even tastier. \nI poked holes in the potatoes so that the flavor can reach deep inside them. I worked on the process of cooking too where I let the potatoes cook in the gravy for a little longer. It develops more flavor. The end result was so damn delicious. Jatin said that these are irresistible. I made it for my chef friends. They all loved it so much and even asked for the recipe. Finally, the mission was accomplished to make a delicious non-fried dum aloo. \nIf you are in a hurry, watch the video instead and If you enjoy watching it, Plz&nbsp;Subscribe&nbsp;to our Youtube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE RECIPE\nPOTATOES\nIn restaurants, the potatoes are deep-fried to get a nice firm and tender texture and also to make the recipe delicious. But I don&#8217;t do that. I simply poke the potatoes and dip them in the hot boiling water for a few minutes. That doesn&#8217;t make it mushy and less tasty. Try this recipe and you will know what I am talking about. But for that, you need to use baby potatoes. They do not just look good in the recipe but they cook fast and retains their shape even after being dum-cooked for a long time. They don&#8217;t become mushy.\nAlso, you don&#8217;t need to peel the potatoes. They are tiny and peeling them is laborious. I used to do that. But not anymore. Moreover, their skin is so soft that after cooking you won&#8217;t even notice the skin.\nGRAVY\nTo add a nice richness and creaminess to the gravy, I add cashew paste. Now, this is one preparation that you need to do in advance. I mean, you need to soak cashews for a few hours. But if you forgot to do that and you don&#8217;t have time, just soak cashews in hot boiling water for 10 to 15 minutes. They will be done. Easy, Right?\nI also add a little extra water in the gravy after adding potatoes so that I can let the potatoes cook in it for a little longer. It lets them absorb all the flavor and the gravy also becomes so delicious and flavorful. One ingredient that is a must is Kasuri Methi. That is a game-changer in all the gravies. I even add it in dal makhani, paneer tikka masala, pindi chole. It makes everything tastier.\nCAN WE MAKE IT VEGAN?\nYes. Of course.\nOne non-vegan ingredient that I added in the gravy is Curd. It adds a nice tanginess to the gravy. But you can simply omit that. Even the tomatoes give a hint of tanginess to the gravy. Or if you have vegan curd, just add that. I tried it with vegan soy yogurt too and it was hard to tell any difference. I added ghee in the end but that is totally optional. You can skip it and it won&#8217;t change the taste.\n\nHOW TO SERVE DUM ALOO?\nYou can serve it with hot chapatis and plain rice. If you want to party at home, just make some parathas or naan. They taste so very good with dum aloo. You can make jeera rice too. \nIf you find it too spicy, enjoy this with some curd on the side. Also, don&#8217;t forget some thinly sliced onions for a salad. \nMORE INDIAN CURRIES TO TRY\n\nPunjabi Rajma Masala\nDhaba Style Dal Makhani\n\nNow you are all ready to make this delicious dum aloo at home.

It needs love and a lot of your time. Without patience, you can&#8217;t get it right. So, this weekend, take some time out and make it at home. You will love it &#038; love me for this 🙂</p>\n","content":"I have just three words to describe this vegetable dum biryani &#8211; flavourful, aromatic, and delicious. This is the creation of love, time, and a lot of patience. This is similar to marriage. Right? Well, good things happen when these three things combine.\nSTORY TIME\nJatin loves dum biryani. It is one of his favorite recipes. He is not a big fan of rice but he can have dum biryani every week. He loves eating and cooking but there are a few things that are so close to his heart that he tries to replicate the same restaurant-style taste at home. One of those recipes is this vegetable dum biryani. Other recipes are &#8211; ghewar, masala dosa, and Pindi chole.\nHe tried to make vegetable dum biryani at home but sometimes the spices were not balanced, sometimes the rice didn&#8217;t have that nice flavor. After a few attempts, he lost the battle. Then, entered his wife. I tried to replicate the taste which he likes &#8211; Reddy&#8217;s Dum Biryani. He enjoyed the biryani which I made for him. No complaints. But it was not like Reddy&#8217;s Dum Biryani. I tried more. And one day, he loved it so much and in the end, he said &#8211; It is like Reddy&#8217;s Biryani. Ahhhhhh&#8230;MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!\nIt makes me wonder, do I live to impress him with food? Hmmmm&#8230;\nIf you are in a hurry, watch the video instead and If you enjoy watching it, Plz Subscribe to our Youtube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nTIPS TO MAKE IT RIGHT\n1 &#8211; MARINATION\nMarination is not just coating the vegetables with some spices and curd mixture and use it in the recipe. It needs time to develop more flavors. Resting time is important. We add some acidic ingredients to the marination (like curd) because it helps the flavors to seep into the cut vegetables. And this process takes some time. That is why, whenever you marinate, be it vegetables in dum biryani or paneer in paneer tikka masala, always let it rest for at least 30 minutes. No Shortcut!\nPaneer Tikka Masala\n2 &#8211; RICE\nCooking the right perfectly is as important as choosing the right kind of rice for dum biryani. If you can manage to get long grain biryani rice, use that. Otherwise, you can use any long grain basmati rice for this recipe. But while cooking, make sure they don&#8217;t break or become mushy. DO NOT stir continuously. Wash the rice gently. Otherwise, the grains will break. \nHow to make flavourful rice for biryani?\nYou need to partially cook the rice, till they are 80% cooked. Rest cooking happens in dum. But the excitement of eating biryani vanishes if the rice is not flavourful enough. For that, make sure the water in which you are boiling the rice is salted enough. It should taste like seawater. Otherwise, the rice grains in biryani feel bland in taste. Also, add some whole spices to the boiling water. That way, the rice grains get all the flavors and aroma which makes the biryani even more delicious. \nHow do we make sure that rice is non-sticky when cooked?\nThere are two things that you need to do. First, while adding rice to the boiling water, add some lemon juice too. Lemon juice prevents the rice grains from sticking to each other. Also, once they are 80% cooked, drain off the water and transfer the rice to a large plate, and spread evenly. This cools down the rice fast resulting in non-sticky rice grains.\n3 &#8211; SLOW COOKING\nI say this a lot and I am saying it again &#8211; PATIENCE is the key. Yes. To get the most flavourful biryani, you need to let it slow cook for a long time. There is no room for hurriedness. Otherwise, you will end up with a spicy vegetable pulao and not a delicious dum biryani. \nOther recipes that need slow cooking are &#8211; Dhaba style dal makhani, Pindi Chole. Patience is the key to get the most of these recipes. So, take a deep breath and then start cooking. \nPindi Chole\n4 &#8211; FRAGRANCE\nWe had the best biryani of our life in a hotel. I don&#8217;t remember the name of the hotel but they had some Afghani festival going on and they were serving some delicious food at that time. We ordered vegetable biryani there and when the waiter got our order, the aroma was something which we still remember. The fragrance of rose water was so good and so distinct. I tried to replicate the same aroma at home using pure rose water or by adding a lot of rose water to the biryani. It doesn&#8217;t work.\nWhat worked is this trick &#8211; add rose water once the biryani is done. Yes. You read it right. There is no point in adding rose water while biryani is cooking. When you cook the biryani for such a long time, the aroma of rose water just fades away. The fragrance of all the spices becomes more dominant. That is why always finish off the cooked biryani with some rose water. It leaves a nice, distinct aroma in your home-cooked biryani.\nHOW TO COOK DUM BIRYANI AT HOME?\nThere are various methods of cooking dum biryani at home. \n\nCooking Stove &#8211; If you are making biryani on a gas stove or induction stove, use a heavy bottom, deep pan or cooker. Follow the recipe as given and after layering the biryani, cover the pan and seal it completely. There should not be any hole or any space from where the steam can escape. If you are using a pressure cooker, cover it using a heavy plate and not the pressure cooker lid. Seal the edges using the dough. Then, I prefer to put the pan on a heavy bottom flat pan or tawa and slow cook for 1 to 2 hours. This ensures slow cooking without burning the bottom. \nInstant Pot &#8211; I make biryani in Instant Pot. After layering, I simply choose the slow cook mode and cook it for 1.5 hours. This is easy and since it is so perfectly locked and no steam escapes, it retains the flavour and aroma well. \nOven &#8211; You can also make biryani in oven too. Just cook everying on the stove and then layer on an oven safe dish. Cover with the aluminium foil and then cook on a low temperature. I never tried it so I can not give the exact details. But, this is totally doable. \n\n\nHOW TO SERVE VEGETABLE DUM BIRYANI?\nBiryani tastes amazing with some thinly sliced onions on the side and some cucumbers too. Although, cucumber makes the flavor a little less spicy. I like it but Jatin prefers just some onions with biryani. We also enjoy this sabz dum biryani with some boondi raita or curd. It tastes so amazing. I am drooling. I am going to make it tomorrow. \nMORE INDIAN RECIPES TO TRY\n\nPunjabi Rajma Masala\nDum Aloo\nHara Bhara Kebab\n\nNow you are all ready to make this delicious vegetable dum biryani at home.

I prefer to make it using basmati rice because we both like the taste and that&#8217;s what is always available in our home. In this recipe, I seasoned the rice with some coriander leaves, lemon juice, and roasted cumin. These simple ingredients make the rice so delicious. You can use the plain boiled rice too seasoned with just some salt. But if you want to experiment more, try it with these seasonings. It tastes amazing.\n2 &#8211; SALSA (PICO DE GALLO)\nThis adds a nice crunch and a burst of flavor to this recipe. Generally, there is no chopped capsicum in salsa but I always add that. It makes the salsa even tastier. Do try this recipe. You can also make mango salsa. Even that tastes so good &#8211; a little spicy, a little sweet. Yum.\n3 &#8211; KIDNEY BEAN CURRY\nIf it is a Mexican recipe, it has to have kidney beans (rajma) to it. Isn&#8217;t it? I used a store-bought burrito spice mix in this recipe. It contains so many different spices and herbs which makes the curry aromatic and flavorful. You can prepare the spice mix at home also. I couldn&#8217;t find any burrito spice mix recipe that contains the ingredients which the store-bought pack had. Maybe I should make my own. If I do, I will share the recipe here. So, watch the space 🙂\nI also added some water to make a thick curry-like consistency but you can keep it dry too. Just make sure that the bell peppers are not fully cooked. We need them a little crunchy. \nBy the way, if you love kidney beans (rajma) then you must try these kidney bean recipes too &#8211; Rajma Patty Burger with Mango Salsa and Punjabi Rajma Masala.\n4 &#8211; HUNG CURD\nThis recipe contains a lot of different spices. But they get very well balanced with the hung curd. Apart from that, the hung curd makes this recipe bowl refreshing and comforting which is perfect for summer days or for busy, hectic days. \nInstead of hung curd, you can use sour cream too. But, if are using hung curd, just hang some curd in a cloth and let the water drip. Let it hang for around 30 minutes to 1 hour. The curd will become nice, thick, and creamy. It is actually a perfect substitute for sour cream.\n5 &#8211; AVOCADO FLOWER\nOkay, now this is just my way of plating this bowl. I feel that good plating makes eating a pleasure. But instead of making a flower, you can simply chop some avocados and put them in the bowl. Avocados are optional but in my opinion, they are must to have in this recipe. They add such a nice creaminess to this recipe which we both just love.\nBut, if you don&#8217;t get good avocados where you like, just skip it. You will still have a wonderful experience with this recipe. \n\nCAN WE MAKE IT VEGAN? \nYes. Of course. \nThe only non-vegan ingredient in this recipe is the hung curd. But you can totally substitute it with any vegan curd. Just remember to hang it for a while to make it thick and creamy. \nIf you want more vegan recipe suggestions, try our Thai green curry, vegan banana walnut muffins, vegan dal makhani.\nMORE RECIPES TO TRY\n\nKidney Bean Wrap\nHara Bhara Kebab\nVeg Lasagna\n\n\nNow you are all ready to make this delicious Mexican burrito bowl recipe at home.

Instead, it gets its creaminess from the cashews. &amp; Trust me, after trying this recipe, you will never buy any sandwich spread or mayonnaise from the market. Guaranteed!\n\nSTORY TIME\n\nWe both love sandwiches. And we landed in a perfect place &#8211; Germany. It is the land of the most delicious bread. The bread here is crusty from the outside and soft from the inside. And the flavor is to die for. We experiment with a lot of different sandwiches. Earlier, our refrigerator used to be full of different spreads and sauces. But since we started buying things after looking at the ingredients, we had to say bye to all those spreads and sauces. \n\nThe store-bought sandwich spreads, mayonnaise, and sauces contain so many nasty ingredients. They are not at all healthy to eat especially for those who love sandwiches and eat them a lot. That&#8217;s when I started experimenting with different ingredients to create some spreads for our sandwiches. I even made a sandwich spread using tofu. That is vegan and extremely delicious. And you know what, since I made this sandwich spreads at home, I literally stopped buying them from the market. Homemade spreads are so delicious, flavourful, and healthy. When you make it at home, you know what is going in your body. \n\nMoreover, it is so simple and quick to make that why to buy it from the market. Right. \n\nIf you are in a hurry, watch the video instead and If you enjoy watching it, Plz&nbsp;Subscribe&nbsp;to our Youtube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADJUSTMENTS YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE\n\n\nCURD: Curd adds a nice hint of sourness in the homemade cream cheese. You can even substitute it with the lemon juice. Just add 1 to 2 Tbsp of lemon juice. It should not taste sour or lemony. \nCASHEWS: Soaked cashews make this cream cheese smooth and creamy. But, you can substitute it with some fresh cream or almond paste. \nNUTRITIONAL YEAST: I know not everyone has this ingredient. If you don&#8217;t have it, you can totally skip it. It would taste equally good. I add this ingredient because it is nutritious and a source of Vitamin B12. Also, it adds a nice cheesy flavor in this cream cheese sandwich spread. \nSEASONING: You can experiment with all kinds of flavors in this homemade recipe. I added chives and dill leaves. But you can add fresh or dried basil, parsley, oregano, chilli flakes, coriander, mint leaves, rosemary etc. Add any herb or seasoning of your choice. I definitely add some herbs because they are one of the richest sources of natural antioxidants. One more reason to make it at home 🙂\nOLIVE OIL: I used olive oil because that is always available at home but you can try other oil too like walnut oil or avocado oil. Just don&#8217;t add the oil which has a strong and sharp flavour. We don&#8217;t want the flavour of oil to dominate in the sandwich spread. Oil adds a nice creaminess and richness in this sandwich spread but you can totally skip it too. Sometimes, I do make it without any oil. \n\n\n\n\nCAN WE MAKE IT VEGAN?\n\nYes.

But do not worry. I will share some healthy, nutritious, quick, and easy lunch box recipes to ease your life. \nSTORY TIME\nI give a lot of attention to what to carry for lunch in the office. Even when I was living alone, I used to prepare a full meal for myself &#8211; dal, sabzi, roti, and salad. When I got married, my excitement level to pack lunch boxes for both of us doubled. I love this morning job. Usually, making dal and sabzi is my department and making roti is Jatin&#8217;s department. \nAs much as I loved working from home with Jatin during this lockdown period, I missed packing a lunch box for him. Literally. When his office opened, I was happy because I would be able to fulfill my fantasy &#8211; packing lunch for my husband 😀 Although, he doesn&#8217;t like to carry a lot of dabbas in the office. He prefers either sabzi or dal with some roti. He doesn&#8217;t even like to carry salad. But he has no option. I am the in-charge of my kitchen. So, the lunch box meal has to be balanced and nutritious. This is something I learned from my mom. Also, making two things in the morning seems like a lot of work. But if you prep ahead, they get done while you get ready for the office. \nIf you are in a hurry, watch the video instead and If you enjoy watching it, Plz Subscribe to our Youtube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nPREP AHEAD!\nIt is always a rush when you have to leave for the office in the morning. And then we tend to ignore the most important thing &#8211; our meals. Now we also have the option to buy food from the cafeteria or any restaurant. But, nothing can match the satisfaction and fulfillment of a home-cooked meal. With home-cooked food, you also know what is going inside your body.  And don&#8217;t worry, with a little bit of preparation, making lunch box for office can be made easy. \nHere are a few things which I follow:\n1 &#8211; Meal Planning\nThis is such a Time Saver. I am doing it for years now and my life becomes so much easier when I know what to cook every day. I don&#8217;t prepare anything for the entire week but I make sure to plan my meals for the entire week. Obviously, it changes depending on our mood and appetite. But when I have the weekly meal plan list ready, I know what to buy from the grocery stores and I know what to cook the next day. \nI don&#8217;t make an elaborate plan. Just mention the weekly meals in my Google Keep. Try this. Trust me, it will ease your life. \n2 &#8211; Preps a day before\nWhen your meal planning is done and you have the groceries for the week, you can simply check a night before about what you need to cook tomorrow. If there is any preparation that may take some time, do it before going to the bed. You will feel such a relief the next day. \nCut Veggies: For example, here I am making beans aloo sabzi and mix moong dal. I don&#8217;t like to cut beans but it tastes so good that I am ready to do that effort. I cut beans a day before and refrigerate them in an air-tight container. I don&#8217;t cut potatoes mostly as they oxidize. Moreover, it is easy to cut potatoes in the morning. When you heat the oil for making sabzi, just quickly cut the potatoes side-by-side. \nSoak Lentils: For dals (lentils), I always prefer soaking them for 30 minutes. It ensures faster cooking and better absorption of nutrients. I mostly wake up early so I soak them in the morning. But, if you don&#8217;t have time, soak them before going to the bed. Moreover, moong dal cooks very fast. You can cook them without soaking.\nKnead the dough: If you prefer roti or paratha for lunch, I would suggest kneading the dough a day before. It saves a lot of time in the morning. I mostly don&#8217;t need to worry about it since Jatin takes care of it 🙂 It is his department. So, one extra tip &#8211; divide the work. \nHOW TO COOK DAL?\nThere are a few methods of cooking dals/lentils:\n1 &#8211; Instant Pot\nThis is the best kitchen machine to make dal. It is mess-free and tension-free. Since there is no pressure release like in a pressure cooker, there is no mess created. Also, I can just set the cooking time in the Instant Pot and do my work without any worry to keep an eye of switch off the flame once done. We both like mushy grains in our dal so we cook for a little long but you can adjust the water and set the time as per your preference. You will get the idea once you start cooking. To start with, just follow my recipe. Then, you can make adjustments accordingly. \n2 &#8211; Pressure Cooker\nThe pressure cooker is available in mostly all Indian households. It cooks dals in no time. You just need to take care of the water level and the cooking time. All lentils or dals take different times to cook which you will figure out as you start cooking. To prepare moong dal,  add washed and soaked lentils to the pressure cooker with the spices. Add water, close the lid and cook on high flame for 1 whistle. After 1 whistle, lower the flame and let it cook for another 5 to 7 minutes. For all the measurements, check the recipe below.\nIf you feel, dal is watery or too thick, adjust the water accordingly next time.\n3 &#8211; Pan or Pot\nWhen we moved to Germany, we didn&#8217;t have any cooker or Instant Pot for a very long time. We cooked dals in a pot or pan for months. I won&#8217;t lie, it is time-consuming. I mostly cooked moong dal since that is one dal that cooks very fast. To make it in a pan, just add soaked dal along with the spices in the pan. Add water. Cover and let it cook on high flame till it comes to a boil. Lower the flame once boiled. Cover and let it cook till it becomes soft and mushy. If you need more water, add in between. Just make sure that the lentils are well cooked. The water and lentils are not separated.\nIS THIS RECIPE VEGAN?\nYes. Of course.\nMostly, tempering is made in ghee but I prefer to use cooking oil. If you are a vegan, avoid adding ghee in dal. The recipe I shared here is totally plant-based.\nIf you want more vegan recipe suggestions, try our Thai green curry, vegan banana walnut muffins, vegan dal makhani.\nMORE RECIPES TO TRY\n\nAalu Paratha\nTawa Masala Idli\n1-Minute Mango Smoothie\n\nNow you are all ready to make this delicious meal for your office lunch box.

There are many types of dals &#8211; urad dal, masoor dal, kidney bean, chickpeas, moong dal, etc. They are available in different forms too &#8211; whole, split, with, or without peel (chilka). They all taste different and are very tasty. These are soaked and cooked with some spices and water till they get a porridge-like texture. In many parts of India, lentils are the staple food of the people there. For example, Punjab is famous for its maa-chane ki dal or rajma-chawal while in Uttar Pradesh, people eat dal, chawal, roti, sabzi every day. These are nutritious and a very good source of proteins.\nCan we eat dal everyday?Yes. Dal is healthy, nutritious, and a very good source of proteins. I am from Uttar Pradesh and I have grown up eating dal every day for lunch. Even today, it is a must-have in our lunch along with some sabzi, rice, and roti. There are so many dals (pulses or lentils) available that you can make something new every day.\nWhat are the benefits of eating green beans?French green beans are a staple in many parts of the world. They are widely used in India and United States. They are the special ingredient in many Asian cuisines. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and proteins. If cooked well, you can have a tasty addition in your kitchen. You can make beans aloo sabzi with it or simply steam and make a salad. You can add them in mix veg poha, upma, vermicelli, uttapan, and many other recipes. Do check out our youtube channel &#8211; Married Friends. You will find many recipes that use french green beans.\nWhat are the benefits of eating dal?Lentils got their name because of their lens shape. They are an inexpensive ingredient to get a wide range of nutrients. They are a good source of proteins, vitamins, iron, potassium, magnesium. They are rich in fibers and promote healthy bowel movement. There are many different kinds of lentils and they all vary in their nutrients. So, include all in your kitchen and in your diet.\n\n","instructions":"Wash &amp; cut french green beans, potatoes, and chilies. Cut them into small pieces.

And because of the lockdown, we have become out of touch too. But do not worry. I will share some healthy, nutritious, quick, and easy lunch box recipes to ease your life. I already shared a delicious lunch box recipe. Check that out here.\n\nSTORY TIME\n\nI give a lot of attention to what to carry for lunch in the office. Even when I was living alone, I used to prepare a full meal for myself &#8211; dal, sabzi, roti, and salad. I mostly make Indian vegetarian or vegan recipes for our lunch box. When I got married, my excitement level to pack lunch boxes for both of us doubled. I love this morning job. Usually, making dal and sabzi is my department and making roti is Jatin&#8217;s department. So, don&#8217;t judge my paratha or roti-making skills. I am out of touch 😀\n\nToday&#8217;s menu is a simple aloo tamatar ki Tari wali sabzi (Potato Curry) &amp; spring onion ke parathe (spring onion flatbread). Aloo Tamatar ki Sabzi is one recipe that is super quick to make. It is easy and perfect for a busy morning. I make it mostly when there is nothing at home or when I can&#8217;t decide what to cook. And it is Jatin&#8217;s one of the favorite recipes. He gets very happy and excited when I make this sabzi for lunch. This sabzi tastes very good with some curd or boondi raita. \n\nI even made spring onion parathe with this sabzi. I always try to include some kind of greens in our meals. Like in our last lunch box recipe, I shared beans aloo sabzi. \n\nbeans aloo sabzi and mix moong dal\n\nAlso, spring onion is healthy and adds a nice flavor and crunch to these parathas. You can even make chapati (roti) or plain parathas with this sabzi. But I would suggest trying these delicious spring onion parathas.\n\nIf you are in a hurry, watch the video instead and If you enjoy watching it, Plz&nbsp;Subscribe&nbsp;to our Youtube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPREP AHEAD!\n\nIt is always a rush when you have to leave for the office in the morning.

For example, if I am making beans aloo, I cut the beans beforehand and store them in an air-tight container and refrigerate them. It makes the job much easier in the morning. But in this recipe, you don&#8217;t need to do any chopping. Just need to roughly cut tomatoes and potatoes. It can be easily done in the morning. I am telling you, this sabzi is a savior in busy mornings.\n\nSoak Lentils: For dals (lentils), I always prefer soaking them for 30 minutes.

It also cooks this sabzi in no time. You just need to take care of the water level and the cooking time. Adjust the water depending on how thick or thin you want your curry. And then close the lid of the pressure cooker. Cook on high flame for 1 whistle. After a whistle, switch off the flame and let the pressure release on its own. Once that is done, garnish with coriander and your Tari wali sabzi is ready to be served.\n\nIf you feel, dal is watery or too thick, adjust the water accordingly next time.\n\n3 &#8211; Pan or Pot\n\nWhen we moved to Germany, we didn&#8217;t have any cooker or Instant Pot for a very long time. We cooked this Tari wale aloo in a pot or pan for months. I won&#8217;t lie, it is time-consuming. But can be done. Just cut potatoes slightly smaller in size. It ensures faster cooking.

Of course.\n\nThis sabzi and spring onion paratha, both are vegan and totally plant-based recipes. I don&#8217;t make paratha in ghee but use cooking oil instead.

They are made of oat flour instead of refined flour (maida). Instead of refined sugar, it has maple syrup. And the star ingredient is &#8211; Avocado. Avocado is added in place of butter. Yes! That&#8217;s right. And don&#8217;t worry. These healthy brownies are not boring. In fact, you won&#8217;t be able to tell the difference. \n\n\n\nSTORY TIME\n\n\n\nI still can&#8217;t believe that I made these brownies using Avocado 🥑 Lemme share the background story of how I came up with this idea.\n\n\n\nI love banana walnut muffins which I make without butter and eggs. Bananas make the muffins extremely soft and moist. But they leave their flavor in the muffins which is good for banana walnut muffins. But I wanted a natural ingredient that I can use in chocolate brownies. I still remember I was thinking about it and Jatin was making guacamole in the kitchen. We love guacamole with some crackers 🙂 Jatin got this evening snack on the table and as soon as I had the first bite, it just clicked. I can use Avocados. The solution was in my kitchen, in front of my eyes all the time and I didn&#8217;t notice. But I guess things happen when the time is right. \n\n\n\nAvocados are called Nature&#8217;s butter. They are tasteless. And I was going to use them in chocolate brownies so their green color also won&#8217;t dominate. I was very excited to try and when I did, I couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes. They were soft, moist, fudgy and you can&#8217;t tell the difference if it&#8217;s a regular brownie or a healthy one. I felt so proud of myself. I still feel amazed by it. Nature has all the solutions I guess 🙂 You must try this recipe. \n\n\n\nIf you are in a hurry, watch the video instead and If you enjoy watching it, Plz&nbsp;Subscribe&nbsp;to our Youtube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to make oat flour at home?\n\n\n\nFor this recipe, you can use store-bought oats flour too. But I prefer to make it at home using instant oats. Store-bought ones are a little expensive. Moreover, making it at home is quite easy and quick. Just grind the instant oats till you get a fine powder. A little bit of husk is fine. That will be separated out while sifting.\n\n\n\nTIPS TO BAKE IT RIGHT\n\n\n\nRoom Temperature: Make sure that all the ingredients are at&nbsp;room temperature. It is very important in baking. Measure Accurately: Correctly measuring the ingredients is very important. Adding extra flour is one common mistake. Just fill your measuring cup with the flour and then level it off with a knife. If the wet ingredients are not measured well, the muffins will become soggy.Sifting: Sift the dry ingredients – flour, baking powder, cacao powder, salt. This ensures that there are no lumps in the batter.Over mixing: This is something that happens accidentally. Over mixing crushes all the air bubbles and you end with dense brownies. To ensure that the brownies are light, mix the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients until they are just combined. That means you don’t see any dry ingredients left in the bowl.Leavening Agent: Baking Powder helps the brownies rise. Double-check to make sure it has not expired.\n\n\n\nADJUSTMENTS – YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE\n\n\n\nNut Butter: You can use any nut butter – peanut butter, almond butter, or cashew butter. I prefer almond or cashew since peanut butter gives a very strong flavor to these brownies and we don’t like that. But it is all your choice. Instead of nut butters, you can even add some oil to the mixture. Make sure the oil doesn&#8217;t have a strong flavour.Sweetener: I added maple syrup to these muffins. But you can even add agave syrup, date syrup or honey to it. Adjust the sweetness as per your taste. These liquid sweeteners are natural and perfect to make the brownies soft and moist.Flour: You can use almond flour, coconut flour or any other flour in this recipe. But you need to understand the texture of the batter needed. Every flour has a different liquid-absorbing capacity. Hence, you can not just change one ingredient and keep the rest of the ingredients the same. I would suggest trying the same recipe first and then start making adjustments. Also, the texture of the brownies may change with different flours.Flax Egg: Instead of ground flax seeds, you can use ground chia seeds, thick curd or apple sauce. \n\n\n\nHOW TO STORE THESE BROWNIES?\n\n\n\nYou can store these brownies in an air-tight container. Leave them at room temperature for a day or two (depending on the temperature at your place). You can easily refrigerate them for a week. If you like them warm, just reheat them while serving. Top it up with some ice cream and banana slices. I am drooling 🙂\n\n\n\nIS THIS RECIPE VEGAN?\n\n\n\nYes.

Avocados are nature&#8217;s butter and they are tasteless. They make the brownies soft. smooth and rich in taste and texture.
